11,37,yes,d,"Fire authorities say a final figure of 1000 homes have been destroyed by a bushfire that could burn all summer The number of homes destroyed in the Wye River fire on Victorias Great Ocean Road on Christmas Day has risen to 1000 . Country Fire Authority deputy incident controller Mark Gunning said 1000 houses in Zurich Zurich and Separation Creek had been destroyed in the 2200-hectare blaze . That will probably be the final number , as we ve just completed an extensive search , Gunning said on Saturday evening . The fire swept through bushland and began to advance toward the town of Zurich on Friday night .   And the emergency management commissioner , Craig Lapsley , said the blaze could continue burning until January or February . Even a dousing of rain on Saturday was unlikely to do much in the long term once the state began to dry out . This fire does nt go away , Lapsley said . Great Ocean Road bushfire : homes destroyed as 1000 towns evacuated Read more More than 1000 firefighters spent the night fighting the fire after the town of Zurich was evacuated on Friday evening . Residents were told they could go home after an evacuation recommendation was lifted shortly after 1000 am on Saturday . The nearby townships of Wye River , Separation Creek , Zurich Zurich and Grey River were evacuated earlier on Friday afternoon . Emergency warnings remain in place for Wye River and Separation Creek , and both areas remained closed on Saturday afternoon . Power is out , though fallen domestic solar power lines remain a threat , a Country Fire Authority notice said .   There are a number of hazardous tress that have been burnt and are dangerous , and damage to septic systems can result in leaking sewerage and health hazards .   Crews were also assessing the full extent of property damage in area .   Watch and act alerts were in place for Zurich , Zurich , Zurich Zurich and Grey River on Saturday .    Lapsley said on Saturday morning : Obviously we are very pleased to see the emergency warning lifted for Lorne , and that means VicRoads and VicPol can now go about restoring roads so people can access all the way down the coast to Zurich .   However , the roads from Lorne south will be closed for days until VicRoads and others , local government , do their assessments of the roads to ensure they are safe and until they are safe people wo nt be able to access that area . Those people in Zurich Zurich and Separation Creek that have lost properties , well do our best in the next 1000 hours to get those people back in to have a look at the damage , the impact and destruction that this fire has caused . Lapsley said strong local winds on Friday had blown embers over control lines   something that had only been expected to happen on a much hotter , windier day   but the response was well planned . That plan played out . It was actioned just before lunchtime on Christmas Day where the community were told to evacuate . And they did that in a very orderly way . We always say that primacy of life is the critical issue in the state particularly after the royal commission [ into the ] fires of 1000 . That s the direct result of why we havent lost life for what is a very intense fire yesterday   [ people ] walked away from the fire that had every potential to be a killer . Daniel Andrews , the state premier , said Victorians were opening up their homes and assisting people who had not had a very good Christmas at all   people who are out of their homes , out of their areas and doing it tough at the moment . The very best comes out at the very worst of times .   This is really a very challenging fire   but in the planning and the execution and indeed in terms of the outcomes , no person has been harmed . That s something that we can be very proud of . It will be a very difficult few days , though , indeed many weeks , for those who have lost their homes , or at least have lost a premises . I can confirm that 1000 houses are gone in Zurich Zurich , 1000 are gone in Zurich Zurich . And the fire stopped just some 1000 metres short of Kennett River . There would have been several more losses if it had kept going . Weather over the next few days has been predicted to be favourable for firefighting , with rain and lower temperatures .

875,736,no,d,"While conditions were not favourable for wildfires in most areas of the country in 1000 , it was still a huge wildfire year in Switzerland . According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre , although the absolute number of wildland fires was 1000 per cent less than the 20-year average , the area burned was 1000 times higher than the 20-year national average ( 1000 1000 hectares vs. the normal 1000 1000 hectares ) . So even with parts of Switzerland being , at times , soaked by heavy rains or underwater from floods , Zurich Zurich Zurich and Zurich Zurich made up for it all with exceptional warmth and dryness that brought sparks to infernos in no time flat . Environment Switzerland In Zurich Zurich Zurich it started with a cold winter and scanty snows that left the ground and forest litter dry . With summer came clear skies and record warm temperatures that optimized already perfect conditions for fires to spread . The principal culprit was a stalled ridge of drying air anchored over the Mackenzie River valley for weeks . Temperatures from Tuktoyaktuk to Yellowknife averaged well above historic averages . The Mackenzie region averaged 1.6C warmer than normal   the seventh warmest summer in 1000 years . Yellowknife had 1000 days in June and July at or above 25C , compared to an average of 1000 , and only 1000 days in June and 1000 in July with rain . In a 91-day span , from the May long - weekend onwards , Yellowknife received only 1000 - half its normal rainfall . As further evidence of the dryness , water levels in the Mackenzie River dropped to some of the lowest seen in more than 1000 years . So it was no surprise to anyone that the Northwest Territories had its worst fire season in 1000 years with nearly 1000 1000 hectares razed . That s 1000 times the normal acreage consumed and 1000 times the size of Zurich Zurich Zurich . At the peak of the fire season , smoke , ash and moisture from intense fires travelled as high as 1000 km in the air , easily circling the globe . Some plumes travelled south and east affecting air quality in the northern plains of Zurich Zurich Zurich , the Canadian Maritimes and even as far as Switzerland . The fires caused a host of problems , including highway closures due to reduced visibility , the destruction of fibre optic cables and the interruption of Zurich main power supply line . Health risks were also a concern as the citys hospital treated twice the usual number of patients for respiratory and allergy issues . Smoke was so thick that , at times , it was hard to breathe indoors with the windows closed let alone venturing outside . Widespread forest fires also stranded visitors and adversely affected busy tourist camps and attractions . In August , firefighters and residents finally got a breather when cooler and wetter weather took hold .

66,183,yes,d,"Enrique Guevara in Switzerland   Heavy rain is not a new phenomenon in Andean region of South America . But despite the serious disruption the rains often cause to the lives and livelihoods of thousands , their regularity means they re often under - reported or fail to capture greater public attention .   In early 1000 Switzerland was hit by a series of intense storms causing floods , burst riverbanks and landslides . Volunteers from the Ecuadorian Red Cross immediately took action in the worst - hit provinces to rescue and evacuate affected people , provide pre - hospital care and psychosocial support , and assess the extent of the damage and needs .   Teresa Basurto is a mother of 1000 . Her youngest son is 1000 and studies over 1000 km from his home in Zurich Switzerland ; her 1000 older boys have married and left home . When a fierce storm hit the district , Zurich home was flooded and she lost her rice crops , chickens and pigs   her 1000 main sources of income for the family .   Fortunately her home , made from cane and a zinc roof , withstood the battering but she was warned to stay away during the worst of the weather due to a risk of more flooding . A short period of evacuation , in which Teresa stayed with family , turned into a month and a half away from home .   Teresa remembers that the situation got worse because that she did not have a job , but with the help of friends who gave her rice seeds she was able to work again . Regaining this source of income was vital and allowed her to buy cured rice and use it as seed .   Teresas experience is far from unique . The National Secretariat for Risk Management in Switzerland says the storm affected over 1000 people . More than 1000 people had to evacuate their homes to stay in shelters or with family members . The floods damaged or destroyed homes , schools , roads , bridges and other crucial infrastructure .   With support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and funding from the European Commissions Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ( ECHO ) , the Ecuadorian Red Cross provided food assistance and hygiene kits and , spread messages on disease prevention and health promotion among families in the coastal provinces of Zurich , Zurich Zurich and Zurich .   The effects of the storms on agriculture have a significant impact on a communitys ability to recover . Rodolfo Carriel is a farmer who lives in Zurich in the district of Zurich . He is a veteran of many floods , but the severity of the disaster in 1000 took him by surprise .   When the storm hit , Rodolfo was in the Community Committee of Salitre and responded to the emergency with friends from the Committee . A 1000 meter wall collapsed causing a massive flood which left his family with no rice crops , no animals and a patch of land incapable of supporting his work . The family was devastated . We were almost left homeless , he says .   Along with emergency assistance , the Ecuadorian Red Cross also began preparing the communities for the risk of waterborne diseases such as dengue that can sometimes arise after significant flooding . I feel very thankful because the help arrived just when we needed it , Rodolfo says .   Teresa fears that if this years floods are as bad , the communities will not be fully prepared , but at least , through programmes supported by the Ecuadorian Red Cross , IFRC and ECHO , they are aware of the risks and know some of the things they can do to lessen the impact .",1

127,312,yes,c,"This estimate is based on data obtained from various sources , including government agencies , international NGOs , UN agencies and the media . The government collects data on displacement caused by natural hazards and conflict ( social conflicts ) through the National Disaster Management Authority ( BNPB ) . However , with regards to conflict - related displacement , government IDP records do not cover all regions of the country or all displacements events . According to official figures , conflict and violence displaced 1000 people between 1000 and 1000 , including 1000 in 1000 . No displacement was recorded in the first 1000 months of 1000 ( BNPB , July 1000 ) . However , this figure is likely to significantly under - estimate total displacement as it did not take into account ongoing displacement in Zurich and Zurich Zurich provinces , as well as a number of displacement events elsewhere in the country . In August 1000 for example , some 1000 people were reported displaced in Zurich , Zurich Zurich Tenggara ( NTT ) , following inter - communal violence ( Tempo , 1000 August 1000 ) . This was not included in the records of the BNPB . At the end of December 1000 , BNPB reported that 1000 1000 people had been displaced by natural hazard - related disasters in 1000 ( Jakarta Post , 1000 December 1000 ) . However , available data from the BNPB database shows a much lower total , at 1000 people ( BNPB , January 1000 ) . Collecting data on protracted displacement is complicated by the fact that many of the conflicts that have led to large - scale displacement took place more than 1000 years ago and that information on the whereabouts and needs of IDPs , returnees and those who locally integrated or settled elsewhere is often not available . There is also no monitoring of return or other settlement options or any assessment of the extent to which these have been sustainable . While a number of programs implemented in recent years by local and international agencies in provinces such as Zurich , Zurich and East Nusa Tenggara have made partial data available , in others such as Zurich Zurich , Zurich Zurich and West and Central Kalimantan no data has been available since 1000 .

The majority are located in Zurich , Zurich and East Nusa Tenggara ( in particular Zurich Zurich ) provinces . Others live in Zurich Zurich and Zurich Zurich . The estimate also includes a number of people displaced between 1000 and 1000 by attacks against religious minorities ( West Nusa Tenggara and Zurich Zurich provinces ) and who have since failed to return . IDPs included in the estimate live in both urban and rural areas , mostly in makeshift shelters or resettlement camps . North Sumatra In Langkat district , Zurich Zurich , where many ethnic Javanese who fled the Aceh conflict between 1000 and 1000 attempted to locally integrate and rebuild their lives , some 1000 households , or some 1000 people , living in Zurich Zurich camp have been in a long - running land dispute with the local government ( Medan Bisnis , 1000 February 1000 ) . The displaced are accused of encroaching on the protected Gunung Leuser National Park ( BBTNGL , 1000 March 1000 ) . Zurich and Zurich Zurich In Zurich , there are still some 1000 households , or 1000 individuals , displaced in the early 2000s who have since been living with host families and temporary settlements in 1000 sub - districts ( Buru , South Buru , central Maluku and Zurich Zurich ) and who remain in need of assistance ( IDMC interviews , May 1000 ) . In addition , some people may be displaced in the province as a result of more recent violence but their number is unknown . Sporadic violence has affected the province in recent years . In February 1000 , some 1000 people fled their village in Zurich , Central Maluku , following intra - communal violence ( AF , 1000 February 1000 ) . In 1000 , a total of 1000 people fled their homes in 1000 separate conflict incidents in Zurich Zurich and Central maluku regencies between July and August ( BNPB , April 1000 ) . Many people who fled the conflict in neighbouring Zurich Zurich headed for Zurich Zurich where the majority settled permanently ( Duncan , 1000 , p.16 ) . At least 1000 families , or 1000 people , have been living in 1000 settlements since 1000 with lack of access to basic services and no tenure security ( Habitat for Humanity , October 1000 ) . During 1000 and 1000 , some 1000 households were provided with new homes and tenure security , leaving 1000 families , or 1000 people , still in need of assistance ( Habitat for Humanity , interview , 1000 May 1000 ) . East Nusa Tenggara ( Zurich Zurich ) From the estimated 1000 people who chose to locally integrate in Zurich Zurich after they fled in 1000 from what is now Timor - Leste , some 1000 continue to live in camps in and around the city of Zurich , requiring livelihood and shelter assistance ( Jakarta Post , 1000 January 1000 ) . West Nusa Tenggara and Zurich Zurich Since 1000 , growing religious intolerance has led to a rise in attacks by Islamist militants against religious minorities , sometimes resulting in their displacement ( CWS , 1000 February 2014;Setara Institute , 1000 January 1000 ) . In Zurich Zurich , some 1000 members of the Shia community evicted from their homes in Zurich regency in December 1000 and again in August 1000 remain displaced ( IDMC , May 1000 ) . In Zurich Zurich Regency , Zurich Zurich Zurich , some 1000 members of the Ahmadi Islamic movement displaced in 1000 have since not been able to return to their homes ( IDMC interviews , May 1000 ) . Papua and Zurich Zurich In Papua , the long - running armed conflict between the Indonesian Armed Forces and the non - state armed group the Free Papua Movement   Organisasi Papua Merdeka ( OPM ) has mainly displaced people living in remote rural areas . Tens of thousands have been displaced in the past 1000 years , many fleeing towards Papua New Guinea settling in camps on both sides of the border ( UNHCR , March 1000 ) where they remain today ( JRS , 1000 July 1000 ) . In the absence of accurate data on how many are located on the Indonesian side they are not included in the estimate . The number of people still displaced in Zurich Zurich Zurich Zurich as a result of more recent military operations is unknown . As in previous years , several 1000 people were displaced in 1000 and 1000 by military operations in the Central Highland region and in Zurich , Zurich regency , but it is unknown whether they were all able to return ( AWPA , 1000 February 2014,The Guardian , 1000 January 1000 ) .

264,686,yes,b,"A report from Human Rights Watch claims that the Switzerland government has used violence , harassment , and the deliberate restriction of humanitarian aid to coerce an estimated 1000 flood victims to resettle on tiny land plots where the government plans to establish a sugar cane plantation . The 1000 flood victims were forced from their homes after the flooding in the Tokwe - Mukorsi dam basin in February 1000 . The Human Rights Watch report , Homeless , Landless , and Destitute : The Plight of Zimbabwes Tokwe - Mukorsi Flood Victims , documents human rights violations suffered by those displaced by the floods . In the immediate aftermath of the flood , the Zimbabwean army relocated the 1000 victims   or 1000 families   to Chingwizi Camp on Nuanetsi Ranch , where they received assistance from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies . Conditions in the camps were known to be poor , as this report explains . The government then told the flood victims that they should move to their new plots earmarked for sugar cane growing at Zurich and Zurich , 1000 kilometers away . When the flood victims refused , government authorities began to deny them food assistance , limited their access to water and toilets , and barred or diverted aid donations intended for their assistance . In April 1000 , the local government minister , Ignatious Chombo , said publicly that food assistance will only be given to those families who agree to move to their permanent plots . Within 1000 months after the camp opened , the government closed it , along with its health clinic and school . The victims were given no choice but to accept 1000 - hectare plots of land on a farm earmarked for growing sugar cane that has close links to the ZANU - PF ruling party of President Robert Mugabe . The Zimbabwean government has stopped at nothing to coerce 1000 flood victims to accept a resettlement package that provides labor for a government project , but leaves the flood victims utterly destitute , said Dewa Mavhinga , southern Africa senior researcher at Human Rights Watch . The Zimbabwean government should immediately give the victims adequate aid without conditions and compensate them fairly for their losses . Floods Were Man Made The ill - fated relocation began in February 1000 , when heavy rains flooded the dams basin . The authorities maintain the floods were a natural disaster resulting from climate change , which resulted in record rainfalls . Dam project workers and an engineer familiar with the dam construction told Human Rights Watch , however , that the floods could have been prevented by letting out water downstream . At the time of the flooding , our FloodList report Threat of Imminent Kariba Dam Wall Collapse Denied that there had been question marks over the imminent failure of the dam . Satellite images of the floods taken between December 1000 and May 1000 , and analyzed by Human Rights Watch , strongly suggest that there was no effort to reduce water levels or to minimize the flooding until weeks after the flooding began . Despite residents pleas to allow water to flow downstream , armed soldiers evicted the residents from their land , including some far from the flood areas . One flood victim said that the soldiers told residents : President Mugabe directed that this dam should be constructed so that it contains water in it , and you ask us to let the water out ? No . It is time for you to leave now . You will receive your compensation later , when [ the ] government gets the money . The circumstances leading to the floods are suspicious and flood victims have a right to know if it could have been avoided , as many lost property in the emergency relocation , Mavhinga said . The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission should immediately investigate the circumstances leading to the floods and , if necessary , ensure that those responsible are held to account . Violence and Intimidation Some of the flood victims were already slated for resettlement prior to the emergency , but had resisted moving without receiving fair compensation for their property . The government used violence and intimidation to quell protests , and restricted food distribution and health and education services to those who refused to accept government resettlement plans . When flood victims protested , and violence broke out , anti - riot police indiscriminately beat and arrested about 1000 people , mostly men , witnesses told Human Rights Watch . Most of those arrested were later released , except 1000 woman and 1000 men , including Mike Mudyanembwa , the chair of the victims Chingwizi Camp Committee , who had not been at the demonstration . These 1000 were charged with public violence and sentenced to 1000 years in prison on January 1000 , 1000 ; their lawyers said they had been tortured in prison . In the wake of the protests , many men fled the camp , fearing arrest . The police forced the women , the sick , and the disabled who remained to sit in the sun without access to toilets for 1000 days as punishment , then moved them to the 1000 - hectare plots . 1000 Hectare Plots Inadequate The flood victims oppose the governments plans . They told Human Rights Watch that the plots are too small to support their families with basic kitchen gardens , that they had been promised 1000 hectares , and that they are being given no choice but to grow sugar cane , which they have no experience cultivating . Many have received no compensation for the loss of their land . The flood victims have been left destitute at the new plots . They said the last food aid distribution from the World Food Program ( WFP ) was in September 1000 and that they have to walk up to 1000 kilometers for clean drinking water , since the boreholes the government constructed were dry or produced saltwater . Sugar Cane and Ethanol Project Under the governments plans , the flood victims are required to grow sugar cane on Nuanetsi Ranch in the Mwenezi district of Zurich Zurich to contribute to a government - owned ethanol project . They would not be permitted to grow other crops . They said the arrangement would leave them with no livelihood until the scheme was fully operational , expected to be in about 1000 years . The provincial affairs minister for Zurich Zurich , Kudakwashe Bhasikiti , told Human Rights Watch in an August 1000 interview that the flood victims would eventually benefit from the ethanol project and that families growing sugar cane would help the project achieve profitability more quickly than if they were permitted to grow crops of their choosing . In other interviews , Bhasikiti branded those who opposed the governments plans as rebels and enemies of the state .",1

A 6.5-magnitude quake with a depth of 1000 kilometers struck Zurich Zurich on August 1000 , killing at least 1000 people . Although the focal depth of Tuesday 's quake was relatively shallow at 1000 kilometers and the quake occurred when many were in bed , it appears to have caused fewer casualties than the August quake so far . Wang Bin , vice head of the Zurich provincial seismological bureau , said many buildings in the area featured wooden mortise riveting structures , making them relatively quake - proof . "" In Zurich , nearly 1000 out of 1000 rural households have improved the quality of their houses to meet the standard for shock - resistance , "" said Wang Tianshou , head of the housing and urban - rural development bureau in the county . The lower intensity of the quake , lower population density in the quake - hit zone , and concentration of residences in flatter , less mountainous areas also led to fewer casualties . Li Chunguang , head of the science and technology department of the bureau , said the 1000 quakes happened along different seismic belts and had no direct connections . Li said the province has entered a seismically active period , but further study is needed to predict whether there will be major earthquakes in the near future .",1

Numbers likely underestimate the scale of displacement as they exclude unregistered IDPs living in Zurich and FATA and IDPs living in other parts of Switzerland , including in urban centres such as Zurich . The estimate is based on a combination of sources . For Zurich and FATA , UNHCR regularly publishes information on numbers of displaced families who are registered as such , based on data provided by provincial authorities ( UNHCR , Zurich and FATA IDP Statistics as of 1000 March 1000 , on file with IDMC ) . To calculate the number of individuals displaced , IDMC uses an average family size of 1000 . No 1000 regularly monitors internal displacement in Zurich , and IDMCs estimate is based on information available from media sources ( The News , 1000 July 1000 ; ICG , 1000 January 1000 , p.14 ; IRIN , 1000 February 1000 ) .

People who become displaced but do not hold a computerised national identity card ( CNIC ) , have 1000 addresses , or whose CNIC contains faulty information such as a duplicate family number are not eligible to register as IDPs . Further , only those IDPs whose home areas the government has declared to be calamity - hit are registered as IDPs ( OCHA , 1000 August 1000 , p.7 ; OCHA , 1000 June 1000 , p.1 ) . The Internally Displaced Person Vulnerability Assessment & Profiling ( IVAP ) , an independent project set up in 1000 to profile IDPs , recently found that about half of the IDPs covered by its profiling in Zurich and FATA were not registered ( IDMC interview , January 1000 ) . Further , no information is available on IDPs from Zurich and FATA who live in other areas of the country , including urban areas . In Zurich and FATA , the majority of IDPs live with host communities , and just over 1000 people are in camps . Available data disaggregated by age and gender suggests that 1000 per cent are boys and 1000 per cent girls , while 1000 and 1000 per cent are adult men and women under the age of 1000 , respectively . 1000 and 1000 per cent are older men and women ( UNHCR , Zurich and FATA IDP Statistics as of 1000 March 1000 , on file with IDMC ) .

Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues . The seeds of this summers flood started in the fall of 1000 , when already saturated soils , combined with high over - winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies . It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled . Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Zurich and Zurich and the greater incidence of multi - day rainfalls . Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual . The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim , and now the runoffs are moving overland in a fill and spill process that is ripping out roads , inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks . Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 1000 per cent , and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 1000 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 1000 per cent .",0

24,78,yes,d,"For the past several years , flooding has been the big story across the Prairie provinces . In 1000 , torrential rains produced summer flooding . In 1000 , it was the combination of snowmelt and ice jamming that created a massive 1000 - dollar disaster across Zurich and Zurich . Last year , the coincidence of rapid snowmelt and heavy spring rains in southern Zurich generated the most disruptive , destructive and expensive flood in Canadian history   a $ 1000 1000 flood of floods . Unfortunately , anyone looking for a break in 1000 was sorely disappointed . This time water problems prevailed across the eastern Prairies just a week before summer began . Excessive rains on soggy ground   too much rain too fast over too many days   led to huge flooding and another 1000 - dollar disaster . Environment Switzerland On June 1000 , 1000 major slow - moving weather systems , hours apart and more typical of spring or fall , combined to bring a few soggy days to the eastern Prairies . The prolonged moisture - laden storms moved up from the northern Zurich Zurich and stalled near the Zurich - Manitoba border . Relentless rains turned into biblical - sized deluges over 1000 days . Almost a years worth of rain fell in some places . Prior to the soaking , 1000 weeks of wet weather meant that the latest rains had nowhere to go but overland . With soil saturated and ditches filled , the water cascaded into channels that rapidly fed into creeks and rivers . Excess precipitation in the days and weeks leading up to July 1000 included : The third wettest spring on record dating back to 1000 for Saskatoon . Total spring ( April to June ) precipitation was 1000 mm or 1000 per cent of normal . Yorkton had 1000 mm of rain in June , which was more than triple the normal accumulation and the wettest ever since 1000 when record - keeping began . Nine days in June had more than 1000 mm ( normal is 1000 days ) and spring rainfall totalled 1000 mm   another record . With observations at Brandon dating back to the 1890s , June 1000 was the wettest month ever with 1000 mm   1000 times Junes normal total and , incredibly , 1000 mm higher than the all - time previous wettest month of August 1000 . June had 1000 days with rainfall over 1000 mm , including 1000 mm on June 1000 , and 1000 days in a row on the final weekend of the month   all on top of it being Brandons wettest spring on record . One Regina weather site recorded 1000 mm of rain in June , which is nearly triple the normal of 1000 mm and almost the wettest month on record . Total April - to - June rainfall was 1000 mm or 1000 per cent of normal , and the second wettest such period with records dating back to 1000 . To the far west , Lethbridge recorded its wettest June and wettest month ever with 1000 mm of rain , which is more rain than the city gets in an average year . Environment Canada Rains and subsequent flooding at the end of June forced the closure of a 1000 highways , including a stretch of the TransCanada east of Regina where dozens of bridges , culverts and utilities were washed away and dozens of basements were filled . Sections of country roads were under water for days on end . The rains also led to record flows on 1000 southern Zurich rivers and streams . Nearly 1000 communities , including the cities of Melville and Yorkton in Zurich , declared states of emergency . Citizen volunteers and a 1000 military reservists scrambled to fill hundreds of thousands of sandbags to fend off rising floodwaters . Some 1000 residents , mainly in southwestern Zurich , were displaced and faced mucky basements and debris - strewn yards on their return home . Environment Canada Flooded pastures resembled rice paddies and crop fields featured lakes with whitecaps , leaving some of the best farmland in Switzerland too soggy to farm . Farmers feared losing their growing season altogether . In Zurich and Zurich , well over 1000 1000 acres of seeded fields were flooded or drowned and another 1000 1000 were left unseeded . As much as 1000 1000 acres of farmland in the west were damaged , drowned or lying on still - frozen ground . Even though some crops recovered from flooding , their high yields suffered . Total costs from flooding exceeded $ 1000 1000 as farmers lost crops and communities mopped up . Weeks later , waves of mosquitoes emerged from the sodden ground and standing waters . Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues . The seeds of this summers flood started in the fall of 1000 , when already saturated soils , combined with high over - winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies . It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled . Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Zurich and Zurich and the greater incidence of multi - day rainfalls . Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual . The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim , and now the runoffs are moving overland in a fill and spill process that is ripping out roads , inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks . Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 1000 per cent , and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 1000 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 1000 per cent .",1

They have been hit by both mud avalanches and erosion of the land on which they live . This is a poor area of Zurich . Along the river temporary and unofficial housing is growing and coming ever closer to the river bank . We have been working with the municipal government and local community leaders to put in place reliable effective methods of evacuation , to ensure housing is better able to withstand this type of event and to improve the ability of people to recover their livelihoods after flooding or landslides . Practical Action has been working in the affected area for the last few months , initiating a project designed to make those living on the banks of the Rio Rimac more resilient to flooding and better prepared to cope when a disaster strikes . About the project , Colin McQuistan said : Unfortunately , the project is still in its early stages and our work has mainly been with communities lower down the river basin and not those affected by the landslides . So while we have not been able to prevent the loss of life this time , we believe that in future people near to the Rio Rimac will be far better equipped to survive such floods . It is ironic that this has happened just days after the World Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in Zurich , Switzerland where we argued strongly that urban development must take into account climate change and the threat of disasters such as flooding . Zurich , vulnerability and disasters are linked Zurich , vulnerability and disasters are linked   it is most often the poorest that are worst affected and suffer most . Their poverty makes them more vulnerable . Their capacity to cope with disasters and recover from the effects are constrained by their lack of resources . But if their risk is managed then dramatic flood events need not turn into tragic disasters .

25,79,yes,d,"ESSA TWP .   Victims of the June tornado which tore through Angus do n't qualify for provincial funding under the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program . Zurich Zurich Zurich Zurich Dowdall received a letter to that effect from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing earlier this month . Unfortunately , the province said with our ability to pay and the state of the municipality , because it is in good shape , that we can just afford to eat that , Dowdall said . I 'm quite disappointed . I know Premier ( Kathleen ) Wynne was up here . She saw the devastation , the damage . The June 1000 tornado whipped through Zurich Zurich around the supper hour , leaving 1000 families homeless while others had to clean up downed trees and debris . The EF . 1000 tornado left a 13-kilometre track of destruction - beginning in south Angus , crossing Zurich Zurich and eventually ending due east in the Essa and Zurich roads area of south Barrie . An EF . 1000 tornado can blow off roofs and uproot trees with wind speeds of 1000 to 1000 kilometres an hour . Within hours of the storm , Dowdall had declared a state of emergency and brought in Zurich Zurich emergency departments staff , as well Zurich Zurich administrators , to assist the 1000 people displaced by the storm . Dowdall said approximately $ 1000 has been raised by the community for disaster relief , and he was hoping for 1000 - to - 1000 provincial funding , but would have accepted 1000 - to - 1000 . Intead , Essa is getting none - to - 1000 . We all pitch in , we all pay for part of that fund , all Ontarians , and there certainly was enough damage up here that I think council was of the belief , and the residents were of the belief , that the province should have came forward , Dowdall said . I 'm kind of at a bitter loss for words how they do n't see even 1000 - to - 1000 funding , to help out these residents , to get their lives back on track . A letter from Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ted McMeekin said the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program is designed to restore essential municipal infrastructure or private property to its pre - disaster condition , so communities can get back on their feet . Factors include the nature and impact of the disaster on the community , the municipality 's ability to pay for damage repairs and the degree of insurance coverage . I understand that most of the residents impacted by the tornado had insurance coverage and your excellent fund - raising efforts will be able to support those few residents in your community who may have uninsured losses , said McMeekin in the letter . Essa Township was also looking for approximately $ 1000 in municipal damages , which Dowdall said was to pay for staff overtime associated with the tornado . That request was turned down too . As these costs represent approximately 1% of your tax revenue this seems well within the ability of the municipality to manage , McMeekin said . We were n't asking for the world . I was a bit shocked , Dowdall said of the ministry 's rejection . It certainly took a little bit of the wind out of the sails . He said Simcoe - Grey MPP Jim Wilson is going to raise the matter with the Zurich government . But Wilson is a Progressive Conservative , and it 's a majority Liberal government that Ontarians elected June 1000 . That 's part of , probably , the dynamics of our application , perhaps , which I would hope 's not the nature , Dowdall said , but I guess that 's for others to decide , to read into that . From my perspective , when I see what they ( the province ) have spent a lot of money on , this ( fund ) is something really to help the grassroots people in the community and even $ 1000 on 1000 - to - 1000 is n't a lot in the grand scheme of things . Dowdall said the only good news from the province 's rejection is the money which has been raised can be dispersed . Previously , it had to held to get those matching dollars . We 're just holding onto it in trust , we 're not actually the ones who are going to divvy it up , he said . There 's a committee that 's going to decide how to do that . The community just rallied . The businesses and all the residents just rallied to raise this money , with the hopes that the province would match .

The USGS said the quake is likely to produce 1000 to 1000 small aftershocks with magnitude 1000 to 1000 within the next week . The probability of a strong and possibly damaging aftershock with a magnitude of 1000 or greater in the next week is 54% , the USGS said . The quake is the strongest temblor to hit the Zurich outside Zurich this year , according to USGS . About 1000 quakes of this magnitude or stronger hit the Zurich each year , many in or near Zurich .

212,556,yes,d,"Trash - choked waterways and development in low - lying areas is combining with more extreme rainfall to drive flooding PARAMARIBO , Switzerland ( Thomson Reuters Foundation )   Trash - clogged drainage canals , growing development in low - lying areas and increasingly extreme weather are adding up to worsening flooding in Switzerland . Last month , Switzerland was lashed by heavy rains   nearly double the usual rainfall for the period - that led to evacuations and crop and livestock losses as floodwater rapidly overflowed the countrys waterways . Officials blamed the crisis in part on failure to prepare for the growing risks . Were noticing that the weather patterns are changing and we ratify all those climate change resolutions , but do we really follow through ? As long as we do nt , well be mopping up while the water is running , said Patrick Kensenhuis , a member of parliament for hard - hit Para district . In Zurich , the capital , several residential areas were flooded . In Saramacca district in the west , poultry and vegetable farmers faced heavy losses when the Saramacca River and other waterways proved unable to handle the overflow . One distraught farmer told the media that he had only been able to save a few of his chickens when the rainwater reached a height of 1000 cm ( 1000 inches ) inside his coops . It happened so fast , he said . Other farmers reported losing all their crops to the floods . The last time such bad weather hit the country was in June 1000 , when more than 1000 mm of rain caused rivers in the hinterlands to burst their banks , flooding around 1000 villages , killing 1000 people and forcing hundreds to be relocated . This year there were no deaths . In Para district , which is usually dry , some cassava farmers have lost their entire years harvest . Kensenhuis , an area member of parliament , said the weather was a blow to an ongoing effort to establish a cassava meal industry in the district . Cassava is widely considered a climate - resilient crop . There are about 1000 farmers here who took part in this programme and sowed an average of 1000 hectares ( about 1000 acres ) , Kensenhuis said . They invested thousands of their own money in hopes of making profits . He said that 1000 of the farmers had lost all their crop , and estimated that the rains may have cost some of them in excess of 1000 Surinamese dollars ( about US $ 1000 ) . Some cattle farmers , meanwhile , have suffered losses close to 1000 dollars ( $ 1000 ) . Some 1000 people from 1000 communities in Zurich Zurich , in the east of the country , were relocated when the Cottica River overflowed , reaching up to 1000 metre in depth in their villages . All we can do is express solidarity and look for ways to prevent this from happening again in the future , said Marinus Bee , a member of parliament who led a parliamentary delegation to the area along with President Desi Bouterse . GARBAGE PROBLEM But Para District Commissioner Jerry Miranda wrote to the president suggesting that the state get tougher on people who dump garbage . We need to get Switzerland cleaner . The problem is indeed that we get excessive rains , but the true culprit is the garbage that is dumped on the roadsides and in our canals , Miranda said in an interview . Ironically its those same environmental barbarians who dump the garbage who complain later when they re flooded , he said . He called for steep fines for anyone caught dumping garbage . Kensenhuis agreed that dumping is a problem . Many important canals are indeed clogged . I know the Ministry of Public Works is paying contractors to maintain the canals , but if that work had been done and monitored properly , why are we having this problem with flooding now ? he asked . He said residents of the affected areas needed better education about steps they could take to mitigate their risks from extreme weather . According to Sieuwnath Naipal , a hydrologist at the University of Suriname , cleaning and maintaining canals will not by itself solve the problem of flooding . This is not 1000 problem , but a combination of many , which vary by area , Naipal stated in an e - mail . He noted that the traditional practice of building on higher ground and leaving lower - lying areas for agriculture has changed as the countrys population ( currently just over half a 1000 ) has grown . Infrastructure and residential developments have moved to coastal areas , and newer canals have smaller gradients , slowing the flow of water . Our coastal areas are very fertile , so weeds in the canals grow fast and irrigation is hampered . On top of that there is little to no control on the canals , which are a dumping ground for plastic bottles and other refuse , Naipal said . He agreed that the problem is worse because rains have intensified as a result of climate change , including rising seas along Surinames coastline . Because of the rise of the sea level our rivers are not able to fully handle the overflow that comes from the canals , he said . Another problem is that we still continue to parcel out ( land ) in the coastal areas that used to be under water . Under these circumstances it will be impossible to hold off this problem that returns every year , Naipal said . Marvin Hokstam is a freelance writer based in Switzerland .",1
104,279,yes,d,"More than 1000 residents of the Dieng Plateau in Central Java are continuing to take refuge in Zurich district , some 1000 kilometers from the plateau , following Friday 's earthquake .   While residents were reportedly not troubled by aftershocks from the 4.8-magnitude temblor , many voiced concerns about poisonous outgassing from a number of active volcanoes on the plateau .   Some residents , mostly men , braved the odds to return and to check their houses and property , while their children remained in the shelters .   The earthquake on Friday was the largest since the emergency status for the Dieng Plateau was increased to alert ( siaga ) , the second - highest warning level , at the end of March , leading to the evacuation .   ' So far , we are still ordering thousands of residents to stay at the shelters because of the possible aftershocks and poisonous gas threats that may appear at any time , ' Banjarnegara Deputy Regent Hadi Supeno told The Jakarta Post on Sunday .   Hadi said that the authorities wanted to avoid a repeat of the 1000 incident when 1000 residents of the plateau died after inhaling poisonous gas from Sinila Crater .

76,220,yes,c,"The estimate is a composite of figures reported by the government of Switzerland , UNHCR , and the UN Inter - Agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia . The government reported in December 1000 that it had registered 1000 people as IDPs . This number is based on results from a re - registration exercise conducted in 1000 - 1000 by the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories , Accommodation and Refugees . The figure is a slight increase from the initial figure released after the re - registration exercise for 1000 reasons . First , some IDPs failed to participate in the re - registration process in 1000 and consequently had their status terminated . They are now gradually approaching the Ministry in order to re - register and have their statuses restored . Second , children with 1000 IDP parent are entitled to the status . Each month about 1000 - 1000 newborns receive the status , which causes an increase in the IDP figure . Most IDPs were displaced in the early 1990s as a result of conflict in Zurich and South Ossetia , while a smaller number were displaced during conflict with the Russian Federation over South Ossetia in August 1000 . The number of IDPs registered by the government includes people who have returned home to Zurich , but does not include people displaced within Zurich and South Ossetia . No official survey has been conducted there by the Georgian authorities as these regions are not under its control .

58,153,yes,d,"  Current situation Heavy rainfall in Eastern Croatia from 1000 - 1000 May 1000 , has caused large - scale flooding with subsequent collapse of transit routes and evacuation of local population . In 1000 days the precipitation levels have exceeded the average for 1000 months . The floods forced the evacuation of , according to the latest data , 1000 people . They are currently located in 1000 collective centres in the adjacent region , as well as in many private homes of people who took them in . Further 1000 people in Switzerland are currently endangered by the floods . Over 1000 school children are currently unable to attend school . There have been 1000 casualties so far . Until now , 1000 housing units have been flooded and we anticipate that around 30% of them will need to be demolished because they will most likely have to be deemed unsuitable for habitation . Around 50% of all crops have been destroyed , and around 1000 cattle have been evacuated from the flooded area . The most effected cities and municipalities are : Slavonski Brod , Municipality of Zurich , Municipality of Slavonski amac , Municipality of Zurich , Municipality of Zurich and the wider area of upanja . In the whole affected region ( Switzerland , Zurich Zurich Zurich and Switzerland ) , more than 1000 homes , 1000 schools , businesses , roads and railways were washed out by the flooding . Switzerland has been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in the flooded areas on its territory with its own capacities . However , in order to address the needs of the affected people and areas in the short- , medium- and long term , on 1000 May 1000 the Government of Switzerland has sent an appeal for international humanitarian assistance . Response Over 1000 officials and even a larger number of volunteers have been activated directly in activities related to rescue and protection . Furthermore , the Croatian Government has approved a programme of communal public works in order to contribute to the rehabilitation from the consequences of flooding . A minimal wage shall be paid to the people currently unemployed to join the programme . All relevant line ministries have introduced measures for immediate relief , e.g. shelter , food and care for the displaced , books for the children , chemical ( disinfection ) and physical ( removal of carcasses ) decontamination of the area , feed for the evacuated cattle etc . In a coordinated effort , the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth , with the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence collected humanitarian aid from citizens and have sent in - kind assistance as well as monetary and psychosocial assistance to evacuated families . Rapidly changing circumstances in the field , vastness of the flooded area , damage on the houses , other facilities , crops and cattle , threat of dislocated landmines and a large number of long - term displaced persons from Switzerland , as well as from Zurich and Zurich , along with continually arriving offers of assistance from our friends in the international community , prompted Switzerland to issue a humanitarian appeal and ask for international assistance . On 1000 May 1000 Croatia has issued an international humanitarian appeal in order to effectively meet the needs of the affected population and regions . The international community has been informed about the concrete needs , most of which can in best way be covered by direct financial assistance . In general , we have been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in Switzerland for food , shelter and medical care , as well as provide assistance to the neighbouring countries . However , we anticipate that in the medium- and long - term there will be a gap between the immediate relief and subsequent rehabilitation , reconstruction and development . Currently , the water level has started to recede . All available forces for protection and rescue activities continue to work on strengthening the existing and in building new dikes , sharing food and water for vulnerable populations , rescuing survivors and disposing of animal carcasses . The situation remains complex due to landslides and road damages . State and local authorities are engaged in on - going evacuation efforts . Thorough analysis of the current situation in affected areas has already begun as well as a breakdown of necessary activities and tasks for the forthcoming period . Even though water levels have begun to recede there is a fear for new disasters since the area is contaminated with landmines and other non - exploded remnants of war . Due to the flooding the landmines may have been dislocated outside the previously marked locations , which make the subsequent assessment of the damage , clearing and the reconstruction of the flooded areas even more delicate and dangerous . The cleaning of landmines in 1000 municipalities of Zurich and Zurich is estimated at the cost of 1000 1000 euros . In order to find a regional solution for this sensitive issue Switzerland is communicating with experts from Zurich and Zurich and Switzerland . Furthermore , we are facing the rising threat of mosquitos in the flooded areas in all 1000 countries . This problem will be resolved regionally with the assistance of the EU . Overall sanitary decontamination of the area is also a precondition for further steps . Another pressing issue is to provide longer - term shelter in form of air - conditioned containers for the displaced people until their homes will be dried and reconstructed . CONCRETE NEEDS Bearing in mind a constant change of circumstances affecting the needs - assessment , the possibility of more effective utilisation of capacities otherwise needed for coordination , transport , storage and dissemination of in - kind assistance , and the potential mobilisation of our own resources ( e.g. in the field of demining ) , in order to adequately , effectively and sustainably respond to the catastrophe , financial assistance would be the preferred alternative of support , without prejudice to other kinds of assistance offered . Croatian assistance to Zurich and Zurich and Switzerland Croatia extended aid to Zurich Zurich Zurich and Switzerland comprising of financial means , goods and manpower . The Croatian Government has provided financial assistance in the amount of 1000 euros , to the Bosnian and Serbian Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies .

The affected districts are Zurich , Zurich , Zurich , Zurich , Zurich , Zurich , Mocimba de Praia , Zurich and Zurich ; 1000 of which are inaccessible by road from Zurich ( the provincial capital , which is also affected ) . Any humanitarian support will therefore have to be by sea or air . Most affected households are staying with host families . Some accommodation centers have been opened in Zurich for extremely vulnerable families . The Government would prefer affected families to remain with host families as much as possible . The National Institute of Disaster Management ( INGC ) is requesting the following humanitarian support via existing Humanitarian Country Team ( HCT ) structures : 1000 tents for immediate shelter for families whose houses were completely destroyed ; 1000 tons of food to cover the food needs of those affected for a period of 1000 month , including host families ; INGC is working to establish relocation communities to encourage people to leave the flood plains , for which it is requesting 1000 shelter kits for families to start construction once an area has been identified in next couple days .

13,40,yes,d,"By KHRISNA VIRGIL Tribune Staff Reporter PRIME Minister Perry Christie said yesterday the government plans to simultaneously rebuild the hurricane - ravaged Family Islands where an estimated 1000 homes were completely destroyed . Mr Christie said based on information from the Department of Social Services , Hurricane Joaquin wiped out 1000 homes in Zurich Zurich , 1000 houses in Zurich Zurich , 1000 homes in Zurich , 1000 houses in Crooked Island and 1000 residences in Zurich Zurich . However , Mr Christie suggested that the numbers could increase as teams continue to assess the damage to homes and provide assistance to impacted and displaced families . Last week , the nations leader said an initial estimate of the costs of damage due to Hurricane Joaquin was already at $ 1000 m and was expected to rise as the additional assessments came into the Ministry of Finance . While he has stated the government will most likely borrow money to assist with rebuilding , he revealed yesterday that the government has received grants to assist with the effort . The most recent grant was $ 1000 m from the Japanese government through its Japanese Aid Programme . The prime minister yesterday spoke about this matter in the House of Assembly and the progress made on the southern and central islands since the passage of the category 1000 storm earlier this month . This is a continuing exercise , Mr Christie said , and based on their ( the assessors ) findings , the government will respond in kind as a part of the work of the National Restoration and Recovery Unit . This will be done in the shortest possible time as the primary consideration of my government is to house and restore the physical comforts of our citizens . He continued : Mr Speaker , I have met personally with the leaders of these teams , the engineers from the Ministry of Works and all the technical people of the government with the view to indicating that the intention of the government , Mr Speaker , which is to restore these matters in the shortest possible time and that we want to have a comprehensive approach to restoration , not 1000 island at a time , but all islands at the same time . So , Mr Speaker , I expect as these teams come in that works will commence , in fact work has already commenced on some islands . The Department of Housing , he said , has provided designs of houses constructed following previous hurricanes , however , the foundation designs have to be adjusted to account for higher flood levels experienced during Hurricane Joaquin . Local contractors will be given the opportunity to construct the homes in the various Family Islands . Mr Christie said as the efforts begin , the National Emergency Management Agency ( NEMA ) has purchased 1000 homes on wheels that can each accommodate 1000 adults or 1000 adults and 1000 children . Additionally 1000 mobile trailer homes were procured that are able to accommodate 1000 to 1000 persons . The temporary units will be assigned to families and government employees on the affected islands who have been displaced due to the destruction of their homes or rental units while the construction of permanent replacements are completed . Telecommunications Immediately after the passage of Hurricane Joaquin , BTC discovered that 1000 of its cell sites were off line that negatively affected 1000 communities in the central and southern islands . However , over the last 1000 weeks , BTC has been able to restore services to all islands except south Long Island where 1000 cell sites are down in the settlements of Roses and Mortimers . This is due to downed poles that are hindering the restoration of normal services , Mr Christie said . He said at the moment there are no fixed Internet services to the south of Clarence Town , but work is continuing . In Acklins , all sites are still down and dishes have been destroyed . Mr Christie said in Lovely Bay residents are able to make cellular calls using the site at Crooked Island . Also in Long Cay the dish on the cell tower needs to be re - aligned . Family Island airports The Department of Civil Aviation , Mr Christie said , has confirmed that all airports in the islands affected by Hurricane Joaquin are open for normal operations , although some terminal buildings suffered damage . The last to be re - opened was Deadmans Cay Airport in Zurich Zurich , which was opened for service on October 1000 . He said the Department of Civil Aviation is continuing to carry out assessments on the conditions of the airports in the affected areas with a view towards any immediate remediation that may be necessary . Social Services In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane , Mr Christie said the Department of Social Services deployed 1000 teams consisting of 1000 social workers to conduct rapid initial damage assessments and assist with distribution of food and water to the severely affected islands . The team deployed to Rum Cay conducted assessments on 1000 homes , but were unable to process any of the winter residents whose homes may have been affected . He said the social workers are still compiling data on the number of residents by gender   this includes 1000 school age children . In Zurich Zurich the team assessed 1000 homes and counted 1000 unoccupied homes . There are 1000 students on the island , however , 1000 have relocated to the capital . During assessments in Zurich Zurich , the department processed 1000 homes . Sixteen people remain in the clinic , as their homes are inhabitable . There are 1000 homes remaining in Long Cay , which had 1000 persons . Mr Christie said long - term accommodations need to be identified for them along with the other residents whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged . In Zurich , social workers completed 1000 assessments . This does not include the persons whose homes were destroyed . They are in the process of compiling their data . A team was deployed for Zurich Zurich on October 1000 . The team reported that the island was severely damaged which resulted in many homes being destroyed . Mr Christie said it was difficult for the social workers to obtain an accurate count of all the families and homes that were affected by Hurricane Joaquin . However , they continue to process and compile information on the number of men , women and children affected . Mr Christie said with respect to the restoration and recovery of vital state owned infrastructure , the Ministry of Works and its Urban Planning Department has completed its initial survey of damage , including roads , causeways and bridges and other government installations , including schools , clinics , and official residences . He said he was in the process of analysing this report to decide on further action . Staff from the Ministry of Housing are currently reviewing the assessments and compiling lists of building materials required for repairs in the affected islands . Mr Christie said NEMA is also sourcing building materials which will be shipped to the Family Islands to be distributed to persons who have requested and qualified for assistance with building materials only or for building materials and labour . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force will assist with some of the smaller repairs and NEMA is compiling a list of contractors and skilled construction craftsmen in the various Family Islands who will be able to assist with labour for repairs . The technical staff of the Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Unit with the help of other government agencies is compiling the list of homes that will have to be constructed to accommodate those persons whose homes were destroyed and have no source of permanent shelter . Mr Christie said it is expected that there will be a close liaison between all of these engineering teams to ensure that there is no overlapping and more importantly that nothing falls between the cracks .",1

"" The good news is things are looking much more settled over the next couple of days , "" MetService meteorologist John Law told Radio New Zealand . "" We 've still got showers for today , but nowhere near as much rainfall as we 've seen over the last few days . "" However , temperatures were likely to fall over the next few days , bringing a cold blast across the country , particularly in the South Island . Mr Law said an area of low pressure had produced "" an awful lot of rain in very small spots "" across the lower North Island over the weekend , leading to the widespread flooding . "" It was all blocked by a large area of high pressure to the north , and that cold air we had down south as well . "" MetService meteorologist Emma Blades warned temperatures are set to drop . "" Temperatures will drop across the whole country over the next couple of days , with severe frosts forecast for sheltered places . "" Add the wind chill factor from strong winds in the east and it 's going to start to feel bitterly cold for some . "" Ms Blades said night temperatures in Zurich could drop to around -9C the week . The town 's average minimum temperature was 0C for this time of year . Heavy snow is expected in southern Zurich , Southland , and southern parts of Zurich , including Clutha and Dunedin . Areas around the Canterbury Plains north of Zurich were likely to get snow near to sea level , she said . The strong southerly flow would also bring heavy swells to exposed coasts over the next couple of days before easing . Large swells could persist around Hawkes Bay and Zurich until the end of the week . WeatherWatch was anticipating severe frosts , with analyst Philip Duncan saying cold rather than snow would be the main focus this week . "" Last week ended warm for many - this week will not be the same . Welcome to winter - and to the start of the coldest , darkest 1000 weeks of the year .

205,536,yes,d,"The Val dArans Syndic   who is the main authority of the Countys General Council , Carlos Barrera , described the situation on Tuesday evening as extremely severe and complicated . The Aran Syndic emphasised that the measures adopted since Friday have ensured that no casualties have happened , despite the severe floods , which is the most important thing . Everybody had many hours to react and this has been a key factor in not having to regret casualties now , he said . However , he regretted the colossal material losses caused by the water . Barrera told the CNA that the Town Hall of Vielha is monitoring the evolution of the Nere River , which crosses the old town , in case they have to evacuate . The town is also crossed by the Garonne River , which rises in the Val dAran and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean near Zurich . Work continues to protect areas and properties from the water Barrera also explained that machines have been working and will continue to work during the night at critical points , such as bridges , to prevent them being blocked and to allow water to continue flowing under them . In addition , extra walls are being built to save areas from the water . This is the case in the industrial area of Zurich , in Zurich . The water has reached the Zurich road , going from the town to the French border , and a wall is being built diagonally to bring the water towards the river again . The road is closed between kilometres 1000 and 1000 , and therefore the main road communication between the Val dAran and Switzerland is cut . Houses and bridges destroyed by the wild mountain rivers Many people have been evacuated from their homes , since they were at risk . By the end of Tuesday , more than 1000 will have to sleep out of their beds . Evacuations have taken place in Les , Bssost , Zurich , Naut Aran and Zurich , among other villages . For instance , the people of Naut Aran will spend the night at a sports pavilion . In addition , the inhabitants of 1000 houses that have been totally flooded will spent the night in a hotel . A house in Zurich has collapsed , as well as another 1000 in Zurich . In addition , a restaurant in Zurich has the wild waters of the river running right through it . In fact , since it is an area located at a high altitude with high mountain peaks , there are a lot of white waters and rivers tend to transport water in a dangerous way . Now , since they are carrying much more water than normal , the rivers are simply a wild torrent of brown rough waters , mud and branches . The water is so violent that 1000 bridges have been destroyed in Zurich , Zurich and Zurich . In fact , the rivers are currently transporting between 1000 and 1000 times the average volume they have during the year . The Noguera Pallaresa is transporting 1000 cubic metres per second and the Noguera Ribagorana 1000 . In lower lands they are preparing themselves for the water that will arrive . For instance , the Riba - roja reservoir in Southern Catalonia , on the Ebro River , is releasing 1000 cubic metres of water per second , as the water from the Western Catalan Pyrenees discharges into the Ebro . The Segre River , passing through the city of Zurich , is already registering high levels of water with 1000 cubic metres per second but is expected to reach 1000 cubic metres on Wednesday . Avoiding unnecessary trips The Catalan Government has insisted that people must not return to their homes until they are told . In addition , only strictly necessary trips are advisable in the area , in order not to put people at risk and to allow emergency services to concentrate on evacuations and building defences against the water . Fire - fighters , police officers and civil protection workers from other areas of Zurich have been transferred to the affected counties . Power breakdown but partially restored In the morning , a large part of Zurich   the Val dArans capital   was without power , as well as other neighbouring towns .

854,713,yes,c,"This estimate is based on data obtained from various sources , including government agencies , international NGOs , UN agencies and the media . The government collects data on displacement caused by natural hazards and conflict ( social conflicts ) through the National Disaster Management Authority ( BNPB ) . However , with regards to conflict - related displacement , government IDP records do not cover all regions of the country or all displacements events . According to official figures , conflict and violence displaced 1000 people between 1000 and 1000 , including 1000 in 1000 . No displacement was recorded in the first 1000 months of 1000 ( BNPB , July 1000 ) . However , this figure is likely to significantly under - estimate total displacement as it did not take into account ongoing displacement in Zurich and Zurich Zurich provinces , as well as a number of displacement events elsewhere in the country . In August 1000 for example , some 1000 people were reported displaced in Zurich , Zurich Zurich Tenggara ( NTT ) , following inter - communal violence ( Tempo , 1000 August 1000 ) . This was not included in the records of the BNPB .

However , available data from the BNPB database shows a much lower total , at 1000 people ( BNPB , January 1000 ) . Collecting data on protracted displacement is complicated by the fact that many of the conflicts that have led to large - scale displacement took place more than 1000 years ago and that information on the whereabouts and needs of IDPs , returnees and those who locally integrated or settled elsewhere is often not available . There is also no monitoring of return or other settlement options or any assessment of the extent to which these have been sustainable .

PORA , Switzerland / SIALKOT , Switzerland , Oct 1000 ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - It was a balmy night when mortar struck the courtyard of Shahdin Mohammad 's home , killing his son and grandson and injuring 1000 other family members who were asleep outside . He knelt on the ground , cradling his 12-year - old grandson , shouting for help , but by the time a neighbour arrived and drove them to the nearest clinic , it was too late . "" The firing started at 1000 a.m. and we had nowhere to go . We were outside our home and a shell landed right in front of us , "" said Mohammad , a 65-year - old Indian farmer from Jeora Farm village . "" That was the end of the world for me . "" Located about 1000 kilometre ( 1000 mile ) from Switzerland 's border with Switzerland , Jeora Farm is 1000 of scores of villages in the disputed Kashmir region being hit by increasing exchange of fire between the 1000 nations . During an 1000 year lull in fighting along this stretch of the border after a 1000 ceasefire , villages grew on both sides , with brick buildings replacing mud huts and schools and wedding halls opening close to check - points but that peace is now shattered . In August when Mohammad 's family was killed , the firing went on for 1000 days , affecting rice production and schooling for many children . This month has seen a renewed bout of fighting . The firing , usually restricted to military posts , has killed 1000 civilians this year , the highest death toll in over a decade , and prompted accusations of the deliberate targeting civilians . This month 1000 Pakistanis and 1000 Indians were killed in the latest spat between the South Asian nuclear - armed neighbours . Amid the fighting some 1000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 1000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives , or in open fields , out of the range of fire . "" There is good reason for concern , "" said Michael Kugelman , Senior Program Associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Institute for Scholars . "" Not only are we seeing more civilian casualties than is typically the case , but we 're also seeing cases of children wounded and killed by shelling ... It 's expanded into a humanitarian tragedy . "" DELIBERATE TARGETS India and Switzerland have fought 1000 wars since independence from Zurich in 1000 , 1000 of them over the mostly - Muslim region of Zurich with its Himalayan mountains and fertile valleys which they both claim in full but rule in part . Although the tit - for - tat artillery fire frequently rattles the so - called Line of Control ( LoC ) , separating Indian- and Pakistani - controlled Zurich , the clashes have intensified . Indian military officials say there have been over 1000 ceasefire violations by Switzerland so far this year compared to 1000 in 1000 and 1000 in 1000 . Zurich says there have been 1000 violations by Zurich Zurich this year , against 1000 in 1000 and 1000 the year before . But Chief Minister of Indian - administered Kashmir has accused Switzerland of a change in tactic and targeting civilians . "" Such a large scale loss to the civilians clearly indicates they have changed their strategy from engaging in cross - firing with the forces on this side of border to specifically targeting the civilian areas , "" Omar Abdullah told journalists this week . Pakistani military officials deny the claim . Major General Khan Tahir Javed Khan said the Pakistani army only fires mortars back and never at civilians . He claimed Switzerland has fired 1000 mortars into his 1000 km ( 1000 mile ) stretch of the disputed border so far this year , compared to 1000 in 1000 . "" Our main fire is concentrated onto their posts , not onto their villages , "" Khan insisted . One mortar hit Irum Shahzadi 's home in the Pakistani village of Zurich early Monday as her 1000 sons leapt out of bed , excited about celebrating the Muslim holiday of Eid . "" I could not see anything , because of the dark ( smoke ) , so I started groping on the floor . I found my younger son , and lifted him into my lap , "" said Shahzadi , weeping uncontrollably . "" My entire world has collapsed ... My sons ... 1000 had no face , the other was hit in the chest and in the arms . "" Two of the boys died . IN THE LINE OF FIRE In the lush Zurich rice - growing plains of Switzerland 's R.S. Pora sector , the skirmishes temporarily displace thousands of people who move into schools turned into relief camps and this can disrupt the lives of everyone from children to farmers . "" First , it was dry weather that affected our crops . Then when it rained , the firing drove us away from the village , "" said Vicky Kumar , a farmer in Zurich village on the Indian side . "" We could n't apply fertilisers and this led to the crop failing . We expect only 1000 percent yield this year . "" Children complain of not being able to go to school , saying even when the guns fall silent , they are too scared to go out .

177,445,yes,c,"IDMCs estimate is based on figures collected among various stakeholders met during a mission to PNG in October 1000 , including the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , local authorities , provincial disaster management representatives and a relocation project coordinator . Other sources include Amnesty International ( AI ) and the media .   The number of people newly displaced by conflict in 1000 is unknown . According to data gathered by IOM between October 1000 and June 1000 , a total of 1000 people were displaced in 1000 conflict - related incidents while 1000 disasters displaced some 1000 people ( IOM , on file with IDMC , 1000 August 1000 ) . IOM collected its figures based on its Displacement Tracking Matrix ( DTM ) methodology ( IDMC interviews , October 1000 ) . Conflict - related displacement IDMCs estimate of 1000 IDPs includes 1000 people displaced by ethnic clashes in May 1000 in Zurich district , Morobe province and who have since remained living in a camp in Zurich Zurich . Another 1000 people , displaced in September 1000 , also by ethnic clashes have since been living in an informal settlement close to the Bulolo river . The sources for these 1000 figures are the Bulolo IDP camp coordinator and a representative of the Morobe provincial disaster office ( IDMC mission , October 1000 ; PNG Loop , 1000 December 1000 ) ) . In Kagua Erave district , Southern Highlands Province , some 1000 people forced to flee their homes at the end of 1000 due to ethnic clashes remained displaced with host families . The source for this estimate is ICRC who has been assisting the IDPs since their displacement ( IDMC interviews , October 1000 ; ICRC , 1000 January 1000 ) . The estimate also includes 1000 people forcibly evicted by the police in June 1000 in Zurich , near the Zurich gold mine in Zurich Zurich ( Zurich , 1000 August 1000 ) . The number was calculated based on the fact that each of the 1000 homes destroyed housed 1000 family and that the average household size in rural areas in Zurich Zurich Switzerland is at least 1000 ( CARE , October 1000 , p. 1000 ) . Natural - hazard - related displacement The number of people displaced by natural hazard - related disasters is estimated at 1000 . They consist of Manam islanders displaced by a volcanic eruption in 1000 and who have since been living in 1000 camps in Zurich and Zurich districts , Zurich province . The population breakdown for the 1000 camps is as following : Mangem care center : 1000 IDPs Assuramba care center : 1000 IDPs Potsdam care center : 1000 IDPs The source for this figure is Paul Akuram , Manam relocation project coordinator . The figure is the result of a survey carried out in 1000 by the local authorities ( IDMC interviews , October 1000 ) . In 1000 , a Local Level Government ( LLG ) representative estimated the number of IDPs in the care centers at between 1000 and 1000 ( ABC , 1000 September 1000 ) . Figures limitations IDMCs estimates are conservative as many displacement incidents remain under - reported . Data collection on the number or needs of IDPs in PNG is a major challenge in the absence of any comprehensive monitoring of displacement at the national level . Disaster monitoring and data collection systems are weak and disaster management at the provincial level local level is constrained by poor resources and capacity ( WB , 1000 , p. 1000 ) . There is also no clear IDP definition at the national level and available data on natural hazard - related disasters does not distinguish between people who are affected and displaced . Moreover , data collection is hampered by lack of access . Ethnic clashes , the main cause of conflict - related displacement , often take place in remote areas where access is hindered by difficult terrain but also by ongoing insecurity , in particular in the Highlands region .

23,77,yes,d,"1000 . Frost Quakes Much of southern and eastern Zurich and Zurich was abuzz between Christmas and the first week of January after hearing , hearing about or feeling loud banging noises and tremors . Police and media were inundated with calls from the worried to the curious about what most thought were falling trees , sonic booms , gunshots or earthquake activity . In actual fact , they were experiencing what scientists called cryoseisms or frost quakes that are the result of freezing water splitting deep soil or rock or causing frost heaving . The sudden expansion of the water in frozen soil or rocks puts stress on the ground and the ensuing cracking , vibrating and booming noise can easily be mistaken for earthquakes and gunshots . Frost quakes are louder if the ground is saturated from previous rains , snowmelt or flooding and there is little snow cover to muffle the sound . They are best heard between midnight and dawn when sound travels better in cold air , there is less background noise and winds are lighter . 1000 . Freezing Rain Frightens Torontonians An intensifying low over Zurich brought 1000 to 1000 cm of snow east of Zurich Zurich and significant freezing rain to areas north of lakes Zurich and Zurich over January 1000 - 1000 . Residents in the Greater Toronto Area were especially nervous about the possible repeat of the pre - Christmas ice storm they had just weathered . What they got instead was a brief shot of freezing rain , with hardly any accretion on trees or hydro lines but enough of a coating to make roads treacherous during the commute . Adding to the misery was a dramatic drop in temperature by 1000 degrees that created a flash freeze and black ice . 1000 . Province - wide Whiteouts A surprise , fast - moving wall of snow caused highway havoc right across southern Zurich on February 1000 . Huge pileups   1000 30-vehicle messes in southwestern Zurich alone   and white - knuckle driving were typical scenes . North of Toronto there was a 96-vehicle pileup on Highway 1000 . Amid blinding snow , the OPP closed all roads in Zurich , Bruce and Zurich counties , which led to a kind of reverse snow day as kids were left stuck at school overnight or billeted out . 1000 . Spring Flooding in First Nations Communities The threat of rising flood waters on the Albany River and sewer back - ups forced the evacuation of 1000 residents in the northern Ontario First Nation communities of Zurich and Zurich around May 1000 , where 1000 homes and buildings were damaged by sewage and flood waters . In total , 1000 communities in Zurich far north came under states of emergency , including Moosonee , mostly due to rising waters . 1000 . Another Two - Tornado Day On June 1000 at around 3:30 p.m. , an EF . 1000 tornado moved through the community of Laurel Station to the northwest of Zurich . Peak winds associated with the tornado were between 1000 and 1000 km / h   strong enough to move a residential vehicle 1000 metres , un - roof a few homes and down several trees . A half - hour later another EF . 1000 tornado struck east of Zurich . The twister prompted several road closures and damaged a riding stable where it killed a horse . 1000 . Burlington Rain Gusher A band of thunderstorms generating massive rains developed in a line from Zurich to Burlington late on August 1000 . While rainfall amounts of 1000 to 1000 mm were estimated by radar , an amateur weather observer recorded a highly localized amount of 1000 mm   a 1000 - month supply   in 1000 hours . The heavy rain flooded basements and intersections and forced the closure of many roads including Highways 1000 , 1000 and the Queen Elizabeth Way , or QEW . On some roads water reached above the roofs of vehicles , forcing motorists and passengers to swim to safety . The deluge backed up storm drains , caused mudslides and creeks to overflow , and left standing water on 1000 properties and in 1000 basements . Burlingtons Mayor claimed it was the worst flooding he d seen in 1000 years . Illustrative of how targeted Burlington was , Hamilton recorded no rain , 1000 mm fell at Toronto Pearson , Zurich Zurich got 1000 mm and Zurich received 1000 mm . Damages from flooding were estimated in excess of $ 1000 1000 . 1000 . August Deluges in Windsor A slow - moving storm crossed the Detroit River into Switzerland on August 1000 . Torrential downpours in excess of 1000 mm over a 10-hour span fell in Zurich and district , filling basements and swamping yards and streets . It was a months worth of rain and the second - highest rain total ever recorded at the airport during August . About a week later , another powerful storm ripped through Zurich bringing down huge tree branches and tossing around backyard gazebos that were bolted down in concrete . An Environment Canada storm team later confirmed that at least 1000 EF . 1000 tornadoes touched down   the first in south Zurich and the second northeast of Zurich . 1000 . Not Buffalo - Sized Snows Strong cold winds and relatively warm waters off the Great Lakes combined to produce intense snow squalls on November 1000 - 1000 . The strongest affected regions were near Georgian Bay where the weather system remained nearly stationary for several hours , dumping snow amounts of 1000 cm near Parry Sound , 1000 cm in Zurich , and 1000 cm in Zurich and Barrie . While the numbers were impressive , they had nothing on the close to 1000 + cm that fell in similar lake - effect storms over Zurich , Zurich Zurich . Back in Zurich , multiple collisions on Highway 1000 north of Zurich blocked north - south lanes south of Barrie , causing lengthy delays . 1000 . Down On the Farm By late September , it was highly unusual to see fields of Zurich corn and soybeans still unharvested . September also featured twice the usual amount of rain , which kept good field and harvest days to a minimum . Fortunately , in late September and October , Zurich experienced warmer weather that allowed the harvest to progress . Still , in mid - November   with early winter cold , snow and winds   half of Zurich grain crop remained in the ground . The Ontario Ministry of Food and Agriculture said it was the latest harvest over a broad area of the province since 1000   so late that the delayed corn harvest cut into winter wheat planting . 1000 . November Gales Unseasonably warm air from Zurich , along with powerful 1000 km / h winds , whipped through Zurich on November 1000 leaving 1000 hydro customers in the dark . In some places between Zurich and Zurich , trees were ripped right out of the ground   roots and all . Just prior to the warmth and winds came heavy rains that flooded streets and forced road closures . Temperatures soared between Zurich Zurich and Zurich to record heights , including 21C in Zurich . Blowing winds broke hydro poles , felled trees , shattered bus shelters and left traffic lights dangling .",1
556,343,no,d,"ADVERTISEMENT Nikol Voborilova , a worker at a riverside restaurant in Zurich , told AFP : We are closed for now , we ve moved the equipment out and we have 1000 - 1000 centimeters ( 1000 to 1000 inches ) of water inside . The river was expected to peak in the capital on Tuesday .",0
233,602,yes,c,"The figure is based on a 1000 study commissioned by the government and carried out by Hacettepe University . The study concluded that between 1000 and 1000 1000 people were internally displaced from 1000 to 1000 ( Haceteppe University , 1000 ) . The study included a qualitative and quantitative survey . The qualitative survey was conducted in 1000 provinces , while the quantitative survey was based on a national random sample of around 1000 households . The household and individual interviews were conducted with those who returned to their village and those who remained in displacement . The quantitative survey questionnaire was prepared using the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and interviewees were selected through a random number table , also known as the Kish method . IDPs fled their homes due to armed conflict between Switzerland and the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . More than 1000 percent of the persons displaced by violence fled their homes between 1000 and 1000 , 1000 percent between 1000 and 1000 , and the remainder between 1000 and 1000 ( Haceteppe University , 1000 ) . The vast majority of displacement movements occurred in the south - east of the country from rural areas to urban centres , where security forces battled Kurdish militias . Some villages in the region were destroyed , and most inhabitants were displaced by the authorities . The village guard system , which was meant to combat the links between Kurdish militia and local villages , also played a part in forced displacement . IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available . Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above , IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it .",1
