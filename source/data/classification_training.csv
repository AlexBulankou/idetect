0,1,disaster,"Flash flooding across Afghanistan and Pakistan has left more than 160 dead and dozens stranded in one of South Asia's worst natural disasters this year, say officials.  The flooding, caused by unusually heavy rain, has left villagers stuck in remote areas without shelter, food or power.  Mountainous Afghanistan was the worst hit, with 61 people killed and approximately 500 traditional mud-brick homes washed away in more than a dozen villages in Sarobi, a rural district less than an hour from Kabul, officials said.  Floods left a village devastated in the remote eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. At least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, said provincial spokesman Mohammad Yusufi. No one was killed.  Authorities have been unable to deliver aid to some badly affected villages by land as roads in the area are controlled by the Taliban, Yusufi added.  “We have asked the national government for help as have an overwhelming number of locals asking for assistance, but this is a Taliban-ridden area,” Yusufi said.  At least 24 people were also died in two other eastern border provinces, Khost and Nangarhar, according to local officials. More than fifty homes and shops were destroyed and thousands of acres of farmland flooded.  In Pakistan monsoon rains claimed more than 80 lives, local media reported. Houses collapsing, drowning and electrocution all pushed up the death toll, said Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.  In Karachi, the commercial capital and a southern port city that is home to 18 million people, poor neighborhoods were submerged waist-deep in water and many precincts suffered long power outages. Deaths were also reported in the north and west of the country.

A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck northwest Argentina, the US Geological Survey reported, leaving at least one person dead and damaging homes. Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey visited the town and promised repair works.  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Salta province yesterday, killing one woman, injuring at least 30 people and extensively damaging the town of El Galpón.  The earthquake hit the town of El Galpón, which is roughly 170 kilometres by road from the provincial capital and 50 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake, at 8:33 in the morning yesterday, causing roofs to collapse. Ninety-four-year-old Alberta Flores was killed by a falling beam while she slept. Local doctors reported that 30 others were treated for minor cut and scrapes.  Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey rushed to the town, promising to help reconstruct damaged homes and buildings and confirming that 15 families have been evacuated to the town hall as a precaution against collapse. Urtubey and his Cabinet made the trip to a town where 7,000 residents live after Mayor Héctor Romero appealed for assistance on local radio.  “We don’t have water, the power is out, what we are living through is terrible,” said Romero to the Cadena 3 radio station.  “I was at home and I felt a strong movement and noise, I got my kids out of the house — which also suffered damage to the roof — I went outside and saw that the school had been destroyed. Thank God this was on a Saturday because if not, it would have taken all of the kids.”  Urtubey has ordered that a damage assessment be carried out so that works can start tomorrow. He also said that even though the situation was under control, the province’s medical helicopter was available for the residents of El Galpón if necessary.  In addition to the multiple brick buildings that came down as a result of the tremor, there were reports of damage to the local hospital. Images and video from the town featured bricks scattered across the pavement and shattered walls teetering perilously.  The 5.9 quake lasted for approximately 15 seconds and was reported to have taken place 10 kilometres underground and was felt in neighbouring provinces such as Jujuy, Tucumán, Catamarca, Santiago del Estero and even parts of Chaco province according to the DyN news agency.  Northern Argentina commonly experiences low-intensity earthquakes but yesterday’s was the third this calendar year in Salta with an intensity of at least 5 on the Richter scale.  Argentina’s most destructive earthquake dates back to 1944, killing 10,000 people in the province of San Juan and wiped out large sections of the provincial capital.",http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/201157/earthquake-in-salta-kills-a-94yearold-woman-injures-30,en

13,37,disaster,"Fire authorities say a final figure of 116 homes have been destroyed by a bushfire that could burn all summer  The number of homes destroyed in the Wye River fire on Victoria’s Great Ocean Road on Christmas Day has risen to 116.  Country Fire Authority deputy incident controller Mark Gunning said 116 houses in Wye River and Separation Creek had been destroyed in the 2200-hectare blaze.  “That will probably be the final number, as we’ve just completed an extensive search,” Gunning said on Saturday evening.  The fire swept through bushland and began to advance toward the town of Lorne on Friday night.    And the emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said the blaze could continue burning until January or February. Even a dousing of rain on Saturday was unlikely to do much in the long term once the state began to dry out. “This fire doesn’t go away,” Lapsley said.  Great Ocean Road bushfire: homes destroyed as five towns evacuated Read more  More than 300 firefighters spent the night fighting the fire after the town of Lorne was evacuated on Friday evening. Residents were told they could go home after an evacuation recommendation was lifted shortly after 9am on Saturday.  The nearby townships of Wye River, Separation Creek, Kennett River and Grey River were evacuated earlier on Friday afternoon. Emergency warnings remain in place for Wye River and Separation Creek, and both areas remained closed on Saturday afternoon.  “Power is out, though fallen domestic solar power lines remain a threat,” a Country Fire Authority notice said.    “There are a number of hazardous tress that have been burnt and are dangerous, and damage to septic systems can result in leaking sewerage and health hazards.”    Crews were also assessing the full extent of property damage in area.    Watch and act alerts were in place for Lorne, Allenvale, Kennett River and Grey River on Saturday.      Lapsley said on Saturday morning: “Obviously we are very pleased to see the emergency warning lifted for Lorne, and that means VicRoads and VicPol can now go about restoring roads so people can access all the way down the coast to Lorne.    “However, the roads from Lorne south will be closed for days until VicRoads and others, local government, do their assessments of the roads to ensure they are safe and until they are safe people won’t be able to access that area.  “Those people in Wye River and Separation Creek that have lost properties, we’ll do our best in the next 24 hours to get those people back in to have a look at the damage, the impact and destruction that this fire has caused.”  Lapsley said strong local winds on Friday had blown embers over control lines – something that had only been expected to happen on a much hotter, windier day – but the response was well planned.  “That plan played out. It was actioned just before lunchtime on Christmas Day where the community were told to evacuate. And they did that in a very orderly way.  “We always say that primacy of life is the critical issue in the state particularly after the royal commission [into the] fires of 2009. That’s the direct result of why we haven’t lost life for what is a very intense fire yesterday … [people] walked away from the fire that had every potential to be a killer.”  Daniel Andrews, the state premier, said Victorians were “opening up their homes” and assisting people who had “not had a very good Christmas at all – people who are out of their homes, out of their areas and doing it tough at the moment. The very best comes out at the very worst of times.    “This is really a very challenging fire – but in the planning and the execution and indeed in terms of the outcomes, no person has been harmed. That’s something that we can be very proud of.  “It will be a very difficult few days, though, indeed many weeks, for those who have lost their homes, or at least have lost a premises. I can confirm that 35 houses are gone in Wye River, 18 are gone in Separation Creek. And the fire stopped just some 500 metres short of Kennett River. There would have been several more losses if it had kept going.”  Weather over the next few days has been predicted to be favourable for firefighting, with rain and lower temperatures.  The main firefront had not gone through Kennett River, but firefighters defending homes there had put out spot fires and no properties had been reported burnt.  Holidaymakers were being advised on Saturday to stay away, and those away from their homes were told not to return yet.  The Great Ocean Road remained closed from Bellbrae to Skenes Creek on Saturday morning but was reopened between Torquay and Lorne.  Community meetings were due to be held at lunchtime on Saturday at relief centres in Apollo Bay and Torquay.  Organisers of the Falls music festival, due to be held near Lorne from Monday, were due to meet fire authorities at noon on Saturday to discuss whether it could go ahead.    “The township of Lorne is now being evacuated, the Falls farm itself is safe from the path of the fires,” a statement on festival’s website said.    “We are working with the CFA, fire authorities and emergency services to stay across the current situation.”    The festival is scheduled to begin on Monday and run until New Year’s Day.  The Bureau of Meteorology predicted a top of 18C at Lorne on Boxing Day and up to 20mm of rain.

14,38,disaster,"PRAGUE—Thousands were forced from their homes and at least 10 people were killed as floodwaters deluged swathes of Europe on Monday, including the historic center of the Czech capital Prague.  Shops and schools were shut and road and rail transports were disrupted across the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany following torrential rains.  The flooding caused chaos at Prague Zoo where around 1,000 animals were moved to higher ground after the Vltava river burst its banks late Sunday.  ADVERTISEMENT  Zookeepers had to tranquilize tigers and other large animals in a dramatic overnight operation.  “It’s a terrifying feeling to experience this all over again,” Petr Velensky, the zoo’s reptile specialist, told AFP, recalling how many animals drowned in a 2002 flood.  Czech rescue crews were searching for four more people believed to have died in floodwaters that cut power to tens of thousands of households.  The heavy rainfall has triggered nightmarish memories of the 2002 floods that killed dozens in the region including 17 in the Czech Republic alone.  The Czech government declared a state of emergency Sunday, deploying 2,000 troops in its rescue drive as more than 8,000 people were evacuated from their homes, officials said.  A house collapse claimed two lives south of Prague, while an electrician was killed trying to switch off a transformer as a precaution, a woman perished when she was hit by a falling tree branch and three men drowned in rivers or drains around the country, police said.  “You realize here what nature can do. How helpless we really are despite having all our technology,” Prague pensioner Helena Holubova said, watching the water rise from a bridge over the Vltava in central Prague.  With Prague’s 14th-century Charles Bridge under threat, a 25-ton excavator was at work throughout the day Monday to remove debris piling up around the structure.  ADVERTISEMENT  Nikol Voborilova, a worker at a riverside restaurant in Prague, told AFP: “We are closed for now, we’ve moved the equipment out and we have 30-40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) of water inside.”  The river was expected to peak in the capital on Tuesday.  Thousands of households were hit with power outages, while fallen trees snarled rail traffic across western regions of the Czech Republic, where chemical plants were also shut down as a precaution to prevent dangerous spills seen in 2002.  Flooding also deluged neighboring Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Two people were reported dead in Austria and another person died in Switzerland.  “We’re in shock. We had to leave home in the blink of an eye,” a woman in the eastern German city of Dresden which had been severely damaged in 2002 told the NTV channel.  She and her baby spent the night at a community center, like thousands of others evacuated in the eastern region of Saxony, where rescue efforts by police and soldiers were being hampered by power outages.  Some 2,500 people were evacuated from hard-hit Grimma, near Leipzig.  Two people were reported missing in Germany.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to visit flood-hit regions Tuesday.  In Austria, two people were killed in flooding and close to 1,000 were evacuated as landslides threatened their homes, mostly around the western city of Salzburg and in the north.  Authorities in Austria warned that the Danube and the Inn rivers could surpass levels from 2002, when the country suffered up to 7.5 billion euros ($9.8 billion) in damage.  Water levels on the Danube, Inn and Ilz rivers, which meet in the German city of Passau, have already surpassed records from 2002 and 1954.  “A lot of people who already had to cope with major flooding in 2002 are refusing to leave their homes,” Passau mayor Juergen Duppen told Germany’s N24 TV channel.—Jan Flemr",http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/420141/10-dead-thousands-evacuated-as-floods-sweep-europe,en
15,40,disaster,"By KHRISNA VIRGIL  Tribune Staff Reporter  kvirgil@tribunemedia.net  PRIME Minister Perry Christie said yesterday the government plans to simultaneously rebuild the hurricane-ravaged Family Islands where an estimated 836 homes were completely destroyed.  Mr Christie said based on information from the Department of Social Services, Hurricane Joaquin wiped out 413 homes in Long Island, 227 houses in San Salvador, 123 homes in Acklins, 50 houses in Crooked Island and 23 residences in Rum Cay.  However, Mr Christie suggested that the numbers could increase as teams continue to assess the damage to homes and provide assistance to impacted and displaced families.  Last week, the nation’s leader said an initial estimate of the costs of damage due to Hurricane Joaquin was already at $60m and was expected to rise as the additional assessments came into the Ministry of Finance.  While he has stated the government will most likely borrow money to assist with rebuilding, he revealed yesterday that the government has received grants to assist with the effort. The most recent grant was $1.7m from the Japanese government through its Japanese Aid Programme.  The prime minister yesterday spoke about this matter in the House of Assembly and the progress made on the southern and central islands since the passage of the category four storm earlier this month.  “This is a continuing exercise,” Mr Christie said, “and based on their (the assessors) findings, the government will respond in kind as a part of the work of the National Restoration and Recovery Unit. This will be done in the shortest possible time as the primary consideration of my government is to house and restore the physical comforts of our citizens.”  He continued: “Mr Speaker, I have met personally with the leaders of these teams, the engineers from the Ministry of Works and all the technical people of the government with the view to indicating that the intention of the government, Mr Speaker, which is to restore these matters in the shortest possible time and that we want to have a comprehensive approach to restoration, not one island at a time, but all islands at the same time.  “So, Mr Speaker, I expect as these teams come in that works will commence, in fact work has already commenced on some islands.”  The Department of Housing, he said, has provided designs of houses constructed following previous hurricanes, however, the foundation designs have to be adjusted to account for higher flood levels experienced during Hurricane Joaquin. Local contractors will be given the opportunity to construct the homes in the various Family Islands.  Mr Christie said as the efforts begin, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has purchased five “homes on wheels” that can each accommodate three adults or two adults and two children. Additionally seven mobile trailer homes were procured that are able to accommodate six to 10 persons.  The temporary units will be assigned to families and government employees on the affected islands who have been displaced due to the destruction of their homes or rental units while the construction of permanent replacements are completed.  Telecommunications  Immediately after the passage of Hurricane Joaquin, BTC discovered that 59 of its cell sites were off line that negatively affected 59 communities in the central and southern islands.  However, over the last two weeks, BTC has been able to restore services to all islands except south Long Island where two cell sites are down in the settlements of Roses and Mortimer’s. This is due to downed poles that are hindering the restoration of normal services, Mr Christie said.  He said at the moment there are no fixed Internet services to the south of Clarence Town, but work is continuing.  In Acklins, all sites are still down and dishes have been destroyed. Mr Christie said in Lovely Bay residents are able to make cellular calls using the site at Crooked Island. Also in Long Cay the dish on the cell tower needs to be re-aligned.  Family Island airports  The Department of Civil Aviation, Mr Christie said, has confirmed that all airports in the islands affected by Hurricane Joaquin are open for normal operations, although some terminal buildings suffered damage.  The last to be re-opened was Deadman’s Cay Airport in Long Island, which was opened for service on October 9.  He said the Department of Civil Aviation is continuing to carry out assessments on the conditions of the airports in the affected areas with a view towards any immediate remediation that may be necessary.  Social Services  In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Mr Christie said the Department of Social Services deployed four teams consisting of 14 social workers to conduct rapid initial damage assessments and assist with distribution of food and water to the severely affected islands.  The team deployed to Rum Cay conducted assessments on 29 homes, but were unable to process any of the winter residents whose homes may have been affected. He said the social workers are still compiling data on the number of residents by gender – this includes 10 school age children.  In San Salvador the team assessed 216 homes and counted 62 unoccupied homes. There are 227 students on the island, however, five have relocated to the capital.  During assessments in Crooked Island, the department processed 25 homes. Sixteen people remain in the clinic, as their homes are inhabitable.  There are seven homes remaining in Long Cay, which had 24 persons.  Mr Christie said long-term accommodations need to be identified for them along with the other residents whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged.  In Acklins, social workers completed 107 assessments. This does not include the persons whose homes were destroyed. They are in the process of compiling their data.  A team was deployed for Long Island on October 5. The team reported that the island was severely damaged which resulted in many homes being destroyed.  Mr Christie said it was difficult for the social workers to obtain an accurate count of all the families and homes that were affected by Hurricane Joaquin. However, they continue to process and compile information on the number of men, women and children affected.  Mr Christie said with respect to the restoration and recovery of vital state owned infrastructure, the Ministry of Works and its Urban Planning Department has completed its initial survey of damage, including roads, causeways and bridges and other government installations, including schools, clinics, and official residences.  He said he was in the process of analysing this report to decide on further action.  Staff from the Ministry of Housing are currently reviewing the assessments and compiling lists of building materials required for repairs in the affected islands.  Mr Christie said NEMA is also sourcing building materials which will be shipped to the Family Islands to be distributed to persons who have requested and qualified for assistance with building materials only or for building materials and labour.  The Royal Bahamas Defence Force will assist with some of the smaller repairs and NEMA is compiling a list of contractors and skilled construction craftsmen in the various Family Islands who will be able to assist with labour for repairs.  The technical staff of the Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Unit with the help of other government agencies is compiling the list of homes that will have to be constructed to accommodate those persons whose homes were destroyed and have no source of permanent shelter.  Mr Christie said it is expected that there will be a close liaison between all of these engineering teams to ensure that there is no overlapping and more importantly that nothing falls between the cracks.",http://www.tribune242.com/news/2015/oct/22/hurricane-wiped-out-836-homes/?news,en

At least 41 people have died and nearly 70,000 have been left homeless following torrential rain in southeast Brazil over the past few weeks, officials have said.  In Espirito Santo state, Civil Defence officials on Thursday reported a total of 27 fatalities, including eight on Thursday, in what they described as the worst rains in 90 years.  They said 61,379 people were forced to leave their homes.  President Dilma Rousseff interrupted her year-end holidays on Friday to tour flood-hit areas of Espirito Santo.  ""We are going to have to rebuild the state,"" said Governor Renato Casagrande amid extensive flooding and damage to bridges and roads.  In neighbouring Minas Gerais state, where the downpours began in October and have worsened in the past few days, have authorities reported 17 deaths and said 4,150 people were forced to evacuate their homes.  A 56-year-old woman died on Wednesday in a landslide that buried her house in Juiz de Fora, 278 kilometres from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais.  Aid pledge  Last week, a family of six, including a seven-year-old child, died when a mudslide swept away their home in Sardoa, in the eastern part of the state.  A total of 79 towns were affected across Minas Gerais and a state of alert was declared in 26 of them.  On Tuesday, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-hit areas of Espirito Santo and pledged federal aid to the victims.

The weather followed a cold front that passed over the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná, which brought strong winds with the rain. Paraná state has been the worst affected, where ten people have been killed and six were reported missing. Over 130 cities have been affected by the disaster and it was estimated that 40,000 people were evacuated.  Of particular concern was the Paraná River, which burst its banks in places. The rising water level on the river also caused flooding in neighbouring Argentina, and the floodgates at the Yacyreta Dam were opened on 11 June to help control the floodwaters. The dam is located on the border of Argentina, and it was reported that record levels of water passed through the dam.  Floodwaters and landslides have blocked some roads and destroyed bridges, cutting off easy access to some of the affected towns.

26,74,disaster,"TORONTO – The City of Calgary says only a small number of buildings may still be without power in the downtown core after last week’s devastating floods in southern Alberta that left three dead.  Officials say some structures may not yet have power because of specific electrical or other issues that need to be resolved first and officials say work will continue to restore electrical service to a number of residential neighbourhoods that were also hard hit by flooding.  In Medicine Hat, inspectors will carry on checking homes Wednesday as thousands of homeowners were forced out as a precaution when levels rose dramatically on the South Saskatchewan River.  Owners are being urged to clean their properties if they encounter problems to avoid health concerns.  In dozens of neighbourhoods in flood-ravaged Alberta communities, thousands of volunteers are helping residents struggling to clean up and around their homes. On Monday, approximate 2,500 people showed up at McMahon Stadium in Calgary alone, ready to help strangers.  Earlier this week, Alberta Environment officials said it has completed or is working to implement 13 of the 18 recommendations contained in the flood mitigation report that was presented to the government in 2006.  The work has included mapping the flood risk of 90 rivers and streams.  As residents continue to clean up after the flood, here’s a brief “by the numbers” look at the Alberta floods (please note: numbers below are subject to constant change):  100,000 to 120,000 – The number of people that were forced out of their homes across Alberta due to the floods.  75,000 – Estimated number of Calgarians that were evacuated last week. 10,000 are still waiting to return home.  2,000 – Number of Calgary evacuees still housed in emergency centres or dormitories.  75,000 – Number of citizens who had to flee high water from the Bow and Elbow rivers after last week’s floods.  22- Number of confirmed local states of emergency as of June 25.  10 – The number of years it could take to rebuild the communities in flood affected areas in Alberta.  22 – Number of active local Emergency Operations Centres in southern Alberta.  13,000 to 15,000 – Number of residents evacuated from High River in Alberta.  80 – Percentage of High River that remained without services and the waste-water treatment plant wasn’t working as of Monday.  11,000 – Number of homes and businesses still out of power in Calgary.  9 – Number of community support centres being opened around flood zones Wednesday.  300 – Approximate number of people who ignored the High River evacuation order.  5 – Number of Alberta Search and Rescue teams working with emergency responders in affected communities.  31 – Number of communities directly affected by the floods.

27,75,disaster,"Wildfires have forced evacuations in two Alberta communities and in the B.C. interior.  Emergency alerts have been issued for Nordegg and Lodgepole in Alberta because two separate fires are burning within a few kilometres of each community, and a rapidly growing fire in central B.C. has forced the evacuations of about 50 homes.  Between 40 and 250 people were affected by the wildfires in Nordegg, Alta., an official said. (Courtesy Clearwater County Twitter, @clearwtrcnty)  The fire near Nordegg, 200 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, has been burning for several days with residents on a one-hour evacuation notice since Thursday.  The fire grew overnight reaching more than 300 hectares.  Duncan MacDonnell with Alberta Sustainable Resource Development said crews had the fire contained, but officials were still poised to issue an evacuation order if the blaze broke through any containment points.  MacDonnell said the fire near Lodgepole, which is about 100 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, is new.  Wildfire information officers with the province said late Sunday that as the sun set and winds died down, the situation with both fires appeared to be calming down and their spread was slowing.  About 100 Nordegg residents were forced from their homes.  About 140 people from Lodgepole registered at the evacuation centre in Drayton Valley. Displaced residents said they couldn't believe how quickly the situation escalated.  ""Next thing I hear was the siren,"" said Gail Tkaczyk. ""And it's the police officer coming down the driveway and we've got to go. No time to think twice.""  ""You don't have enough time to really think properly,"" said Evangeline Braun. ""Grabbed my dog and it was get on the road. That was that quick. So there wasn't much time at all.""  Braun said the volunteers at the evacuation centre have been kind and helpful. ""I want to say thank you to all of them,"" she said.  1,260 hectares burn near Lodgepole  Roughly 1,260 hectares were burning in the fire near Lodgepole by early Monday evening as winds had pushed the blaze towards the community.  About 120 firefighters were on the ground, with more expected on Tuesday.  The fire was considered ""laying low"" as of Monday at noon, but firefighters remained concerned the winds could pick up in the afternoon.  Residents living a few miles east of Lodgepole near Highway 620 and Range Road 90 are taking in stride a one-hour evacuation alert.  ""Nothing we haven't seen before,"" said Ken Newby as he continued doing chores around the yard, noting there was less smoke than yesterday.  George Cook said he ""didn't think it was anything to be concerned about,"" leaving for work as usual in Drayton Valley Monday morning.  Alberta issued a fire weather advisory for the province Sunday, saying that high winds and dry temperatures made the likelihood of uncontrolled wildfires high.  Residents of Nordegg are being told to go to Rocky Mountain House about 100 kilometres east of the community.  Lodgepole residents are being told to go to Drayton Valley, which is about 50 kilometres away.  Last week, a provincial official said conditions in some areas were similar to May 2011 when flames roared through the town of Slave Lake, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands of people to flee. The wildfire caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, including firefighting and relief costs.  In B.C., the 1,100-hectare Spatsum Creek fire, west of Kamloops and about 20 kilometres south of Ashton, has more than doubled in size since Saturday as winds have fanned the flames.  Kevin Skrepnek, spokesman for the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch, says hot weather has caused an increase in the number of wildfires this year. There have already been 177 wildfires in the province since April 1 — all but two have been caused by human error.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/wildfires-force-evacuations-in-alberta-b-c-1.1300308,en
28,77,disaster,"1. Frost Quakes  Much of southern and eastern Ontario and Quebec was abuzz between Christmas and the first week of January after hearing, hearing about or feeling loud banging noises and tremors. Police and media were inundated with calls from the worried to the curious about what most thought were falling trees, sonic booms, gunshots or earthquake activity. In actual fact, they were experiencing what scientists called cryoseisms or “frost quakes” that are the result of freezing water splitting deep soil or rock or causing frost heaving. The sudden expansion of the water in frozen soil or rocks puts stress on the ground and the ensuing cracking, vibrating and booming noise can easily be mistaken for earthquakes and gunshots. Frost quakes are louder if the ground is saturated from previous rains, snowmelt or flooding and there is little snow cover to muffle the sound. They are best heard between midnight and dawn when sound travels better in cold air, there is less background noise and winds are lighter.  2. Freezing Rain Frightens Torontonians  An intensifying low over Arkansas brought 15 to 20 cm of snow east of Lake Huron and significant freezing rain to areas north of lakes Erie and Ontario over January 5-6. Residents in the Greater Toronto Area were especially nervous about the possible repeat of the pre-Christmas ice storm they had just weathered. What they got instead was a brief shot of freezing rain, with hardly any accretion on trees or hydro lines but enough of a coating to make roads treacherous during the commute. Adding to the misery was a dramatic drop in temperature by 17 degrees that created a flash freeze and black ice.  3. Province-wide Whiteouts  A surprise, fast-moving wall of snow caused highway havoc right across southern Ontario on February 27. Huge pileups – three 30-vehicle messes in southwestern Ontario alone – and white-knuckle driving were typical scenes. North of Toronto there was a 96-vehicle pileup on Highway 400. Amid blinding snow, the OPP closed all roads in Huron, Bruce and Perth counties, which led to a kind of reverse snow day as kids were left stuck at school overnight or billeted out.  4. Spring Flooding in First Nations Communities  The threat of rising flood waters on the Albany River and sewer back-ups forced the evacuation of 2,000 residents in the northern Ontario First Nation communities of Kashechewan and Attawapiskat around May 11, where 40 homes and buildings were damaged by sewage and flood waters. In total, eight communities in Ontario’s far north came under states of emergency, including Moosonee, mostly due to rising waters.  5. Another Two-Tornado Day  On June 24 at around 3:30 p.m., an EF1 tornado moved through the community of Laurel Station to the northwest of Orangeville. Peak winds associated with the tornado were between 135 and 175 km/h – strong enough to move a residential vehicle three metres, un-roof a few homes and down several trees. A half-hour later another EF1 tornado struck east of Tottenham. The twister prompted several road closures and damaged a riding stable where it killed a horse.  6. Burlington Rain Gusher  A band of thunderstorms generating massive rains developed in a line from Freelton to Burlington late on August 4. While rainfall amounts of 100 to 150 mm were estimated by radar, an amateur weather observer recorded a highly localized amount of 190 mm – a two-month supply – in four hours. The heavy rain flooded basements and intersections and forced the closure of many roads including Highways 403, 407 and the Queen Elizabeth Way, or QEW. On some roads water reached above the roofs of vehicles, forcing motorists and passengers to swim to safety. The deluge backed up storm drains, caused mudslides and creeks to overflow, and left standing water on 300 properties and in 500 basements. Burlington’s Mayor claimed it was the worst flooding he’d seen in 20 years. Illustrative of how targeted Burlington was, Hamilton recorded no rain, 3 mm fell at Toronto Pearson, Toronto Island got 1 mm and Vineland received 1.3 mm. Damages from flooding were estimated in excess of $90 million.  7. August Deluges in Windsor  A slow-moving storm crossed the Detroit River into Canada on August 11. Torrential downpours in excess of 70 mm over a 10-hour span fell in Windsor and district, filling basements and swamping yards and streets. It was a month’s worth of rain and the second-highest rain total ever recorded at the airport during August. About a week later, another powerful storm ripped through Windsor bringing down huge tree branches and tossing around backyard gazebos that were bolted down in concrete. An Environment Canada storm team later confirmed that at least two EF0 tornadoes touched down − the first in south Windsor and the second northeast of Harrow.  8. Not Buffalo-Sized Snows  Strong cold winds and relatively warm waters off the Great Lakes combined to produce intense snow squalls on November 19-20. The strongest affected regions were near Georgian Bay where the weather system remained nearly stationary for several hours, dumping snow amounts of 90 cm near Parry Sound, 40 cm in Huntsville, and 20 cm in Bracebridge and Barrie. While the numbers were impressive, they had nothing on the close to 200+ cm that fell in similar lake-effect storms over Buffalo, New York. Back in Ontario, multiple collisions on Highway 400 north of Toronto blocked north-south lanes south of Barrie, causing lengthy delays.  9. Down On the Farm  By late September, it was highly unusual to see fields of Ontario corn and soybeans still unharvested. September also featured twice the usual amount of rain, which kept good field and harvest days to a minimum. Fortunately, in late September and October, Ontario experienced warmer weather that allowed the harvest to progress. Still, in mid-November – with early winter cold, snow and winds − half of Ontario’s grain crop remained in the ground. The Ontario Ministry of Food and Agriculture said it was the latest harvest over a broad area of the province since 1992 – so late that the delayed corn harvest cut into winter wheat planting.  10. November Gales  Unseasonably warm air from Texas, along with powerful 100 km/h winds, whipped through Ontario on November 24 leaving 87,000 hydro customers in the dark. In some places between Windsor and Kingston, trees were ripped right out of the ground – roots and all. Just prior to the warmth and winds came heavy rains that flooded streets and forced road closures. Temperatures soared between St. Catharines and Ottawa to record heights, including 21°C in Cornwall. Blowing winds broke hydro poles, felled trees, shattered bus shelters and left traffic lights dangling.",http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C8D88613-1&offset=15&toc=show,en
29,78,disaster,"For the past several years, flooding has been the big story across the Prairie provinces. In 2005, torrential rains produced summer flooding. In 2011, it was the combination of snowmelt and ice jamming that created a massive billion-dollar disaster across Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Last year, the coincidence of rapid snowmelt and heavy spring rains in southern Alberta generated the most disruptive, destructive and expensive flood in Canadian history – a $6 billion flood of floods. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a break in 2014 was sorely disappointed. This time water problems prevailed across the eastern Prairies just a week before summer began. Excessive rains on soggy ground − too much rain too fast over too many days – led to huge flooding and another billion-dollar disaster.  ©Environment Canada  On June 15, two major slow-moving weather systems, hours apart and more typical of spring or fall, combined to bring a few soggy days to the eastern Prairies. The prolonged moisture-laden storms moved up from the northern United States and stalled near the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. Relentless rains turned into biblical-sized deluges over three days. Almost a year’s worth of rain fell in some places. Prior to the soaking, three weeks of wet weather meant that the latest rains had nowhere to go but overland. With soil saturated and ditches filled, the water cascaded into channels that rapidly fed into creeks and rivers.  Excess precipitation in the days and weeks leading up to July 1 included:  The third wettest spring on record dating back to 1892 for Saskatoon. Total spring (April to June) precipitation was 230 mm or 175 per cent of normal.  Yorkton had 252 mm of rain in June, which was more than triple the normal accumulation and the wettest ever since 1884 when record-keeping began. Nine days in June had more than 10 mm (normal is 2 days) and spring rainfall totalled 357 mm – another record.  With observations at Brandon dating back to the 1890s, June 2014 was the wettest month ever with 252 mm – three times June’s normal total and, incredibly, 34 mm higher than the all-time previous wettest month of August 1980. June had four days with rainfall over 25 mm, including 75 mm on June 19, and three days in a row on the final weekend of the month – all on top of it being Brandon’s wettest spring on record.  One Regina weather site recorded 198 mm of rain in June, which is nearly triple the normal of 70 mm and almost the wettest month on record. Total April-to-June rainfall was 312 mm or 216 per cent of normal, and the second wettest such period with records dating back to 1883.  To the far west, Lethbridge recorded its wettest June and wettest month ever with 280 mm of rain, which is more rain than the city gets in an average year.  ©Environment Canada  Rains and subsequent flooding at the end of June forced the closure of a hundred highways, including a stretch of the TransCanada east of Regina where dozens of bridges, culverts and utilities were washed away and dozens of basements were filled. Sections of country roads were under water for days on end. The rains also led to record flows on 17 southern Manitoba rivers and streams. Nearly 100 communities, including the cities of Melville and Yorkton in Saskatchewan, declared states of emergency. Citizen volunteers and a thousand military reservists scrambled to fill hundreds of thousands of sandbags to fend off rising floodwaters. Some 1,000 residents, mainly in southwestern Manitoba, were displaced and faced mucky basements and debris-strewn yards on their return home.  ©Environment Canada  Flooded pastures resembled rice paddies and crop fields featured lakes with whitecaps, leaving some of the best farmland in Canada too soggy to farm. Farmers feared losing their growing season altogether. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, well over one million acres of seeded fields were flooded or drowned and another two million were left unseeded. As much as six million acres of farmland in the west were damaged, drowned or lying on still-frozen ground. Even though some crops recovered from flooding, their high yields suffered. Total costs from flooding exceeded $1 billion as farmers lost crops and communities mopped up. Weeks later, waves of mosquitoes emerged from the sodden ground and standing waters. Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues.  The seeds of this summer’s flood started in the fall of 2013, when already saturated soils, combined with high over-winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies. It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled. Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the greater incidence of multi-day rainfalls. Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual. The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim, and now the runoffs are moving overland in a “fill and spill process” that is ripping out roads, inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks. Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 60 per cent, and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 50 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 32 per cent.",http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C8D88613-1&offset=3&toc=show,en
30,79,disaster,"ESSA TWP. – Victims of the June tornado which tore through Angus don't qualify for provincial funding under the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program.  Essa Township Mayor Terry Dowdall received a letter to that effect from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing earlier this month.  “Unfortunately, the province said with our ability to pay and the state of the municipality, because it is in good shape, that we can just afford to eat that,” Dowdall said. “I'm quite disappointed. I know Premier (Kathleen) Wynne was up here. She saw the devastation, the damage.”  The June 17 tornado whipped through Essa Township around the supper hour, leaving 100 families homeless while others had to clean up downed trees and debris.  The EF2 tornado left a 13-kilometre track of destruction - beginning in south Angus, crossing Essa Township and eventually ending due east in the Essa and Athabaska roads area of south Barrie. An EF2 tornado can blow off roofs and uproot trees with wind speeds of 180 to 220 kilometres an hour.  Within hours of the storm, Dowdall had declared a state of emergency and brought in Essa Township emergency departments staff, as well Simcoe County administrators, to assist the 300 people displaced by the storm.  Dowdall said approximately $140,000 has been raised by the community for disaster relief, and he was hoping for two-to-one provincial funding, but would have accepted one-to-one.  Intead, Essa is getting none-to-one.  “We all pitch in, we all pay for part of that fund, all Ontarians, and there certainly was enough damage up here that I think council was of the belief, and the residents were of the belief, that the province should have came forward,” Dowdall said.  “I'm kind of at a bitter loss for words how they don't see even one-to-one funding, to help out these residents, to get their lives back on track.”  A letter from Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ted McMeekin said the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program is designed to restore essential municipal infrastructure or private property to its pre-disaster condition, so communities can get back on their feet.  Factors include the nature and impact of the disaster on the community, the municipality's ability to pay for damage repairs and the degree of insurance coverage.  “I understand that most of the residents impacted by the tornado had insurance coverage and your excellent fund-raising efforts will be able to support those few residents in your community who may have uninsured losses,” said McMeekin in the letter.  Essa Township was also looking for approximately $55,000 in municipal damages, which Dowdall said was to pay for staff overtime associated with the tornado.  That request was turned down too.  “As these costs represent approximately 1% of your tax revenue this seems well within the ability of the municipality to manage,” McMeekin said.  “We weren't asking for the world. I was a bit shocked,” Dowdall said of the ministry's rejection. “It certainly took a little bit of the wind out of the sails.”  He said Simcoe-Grey MPP Jim Wilson is going to raise the matter with the Ontario government.  But Wilson is a Progressive Conservative, and it's a majority Liberal government that Ontarians elected June 12.  “That's part of, probably, the dynamics of our application, perhaps, which I would hope's not the nature,” Dowdall said, “but I guess that's for others to decide, to read into that.  “From my perspective, when I see what they (the province) have spent a lot of money on, this (fund) is something really to help the grassroots people in the community and even $140,000 on one-to-one isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things.”  Dowdall said the only good news from the province's rejection is the money which has been raised can be dispersed. Previously, it had to held to get those matching dollars.  “We're just holding onto it in trust, we're not actually the ones who are going to divvy it up,” he said. “There's a committee that's going to decide how to do that.  “The community just rallied. The businesses and all the residents just rallied to raise this money, with the hopes that the province would match.”  Asked Thursday how much money was in the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program, a Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing spokesman said the government does not have a set budget for it.

Several hours before, the woman, the sole victim so far in a 6.6-magnitude quake that jolted southwest China's Yunnan Province at 9:49 p.m. on Tuesday, was still fast asleep.  ""When it happened, I had been sleeping for half an hour already,"" said Qiongfen's grieving husband, Dao Wenguang, from Mangla Village of Yongping Town, five kilometers away from the epicenter.  Feeling the tremor, Dao Wenguang and their children soon fled the house. ""But I didn't see her, and there was no reply when we called her name,"" the man said.  Dao Qiongfen was later found under a collapsed wall, unable to breathe and her waist broken.  As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, about 13 hours after the earthquake in Jinggu County, Pu'er, at least one person was dead and 324 others were injured, including eight in critical condition.  A total of 124,600 people from five counties and districts were affected, and some 58,980 people were evacuated. The quake also toppled 6,988 buildings and damaged 13,842 more.  In Mangla Village, where many villagers, like Dao, are of the Dai ethnic minority group, a Xinhua reporter saw cracks on buildings. Some adobe walls had collapsed, and broken bricks and tiles were scattered in the streets.  Villagers spent the night outside, and dozens of tents were pitched.  In nearby Mangfei Village, people gathered on a basketball court. They sat around a bonfire during the cold night.

Chan-Hom, the ninth typhoon this year, made landfall on Saturday at 4:40 p.m. in Zhujiajian Township in the island city of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.  According to the provincial meteorological station, Chan-Hom, which packed winds of up to 53 meters per second in Dinghai and 49 meters per second in Shipu, downgraded to a tropical storm at 9 a.m. Sunday and left.  Data from the provincial hydrographic office show the average amount of rainfall in Zhejiang reached 77 millimeters from Saturday to Sunday. Ningbo City registered 217 mm of rain and neighboring Yuyao City 322 mm.  No casualties have been reported. A total of 1.92 million people in nine cities have been affected, including more than 1.11 million who were evacuated.  Direct economic losses are estimated at 5.86 billion yuan (940 million U.S. dollars), according to the provincial flood control and drought prevention headquarters.  The worst hit sector is agriculture with economic losses of 3.62 billion yuan, because the typhoon coincided with the picking period of vegetables and melons and wrecked havoc on agricultural facilities, the headquarters said.  Local government warned of water-logging disasters in some cities and torrents in mountainous regions following the record rainfall brought by the typhoon.  As of early Sunday morning, the storm has passed the same latitude as Shanghai about 100 kilometers off the city's coast and moved towards northeast, the municipal meteorological observatory said.  The city government has lifted the warning as rains and winds weakened significantly on Sunday.  According to the city's flood control authority, Shanghai evacuated 163,000 people and called back 3,000 ships to harbor on Saturday, as the city experienced rainstorms of up to 114.6 mm and strong gales of over 30 meters per second.  On Saturday, the typhoon prostrated more than 3,000 trees in Shanghai and forced the city's subway to suspend service on some stretches. More than 1,000 flights have been canceled at the city's two airports.  The neighboring Jiangsu Province also ended the emergency response on Sunday noon after Chan-Hom, which forced more than 78,900 people to be evacuated and 22,423 ships recalled, failed to bring more rain or wind to the province, local flood control and drought prevention headquarters said.  However, many rivers and lakes are still running above the warning water lines, leading to high potential of floods and mudslides, the headquarters warned.",http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-07/13/c_134405534.htm,en

Seven people were killed in typhoon-triggered tornados in the southern province of Guangdong while seven died in landslides, Xinhua said citing the provincial civil affairs department.  Three fishermen died in boat accidents at sea while one person was found dead in the debris of a house that collapsed during the storm. Four fishermen were missing, Xinhua said.  The storm made landfall in Zhanjiang prefecture in the southwest of Guangdong province on Sunday, triggering widespread blackouts.  For most of its passage across the South China Sea after crossing the Philippines, Mujigae was a tropical storm then low-level typhoon. As it approached land, however, Mujigae intensified to a category 2 cyclone with sustained winds of 154-177 km/h on the international Saffir-Simpson wind scale, then jumped to Category 4 – with winds up to 298km/h capable of causing catastrophic damage – as it crossed land. The highest category on the scale is 5, or “super typhoon”.  Mujigae’s affects were felt over much of western and central Guangdong, hundreds of kilometres from the storm’s centre. Its outer rainbands spawned tornadoes that killed at least three people in Foshan, near Guangdong, while some of the heaviest rain fell in Hong Kong.  Winds knocked out power grids along the coast and authorities cancelled dozens of flights and suspended high-speed trains.

At 09H00 local time (UTC+3) the weather system was located 250 km north-east of Morondava and is currently moving in a south-easterly direction into the Mozambique Channel. The National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) have lifted all alerts. See attached map.  A multi-sector aerial assessment of the inaccessible districts of Soalalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy identified damaged classrooms and flooded agricultural fields. There are reportedly needs in the sector of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), but most healthcare centres appear intact. The Prime Minister visited Soalala today, bringing relief items including water treatment products, medicines and cash.  Initial results indicate that 919 people have been displaced, of which some will be able to return home in the coming days. Over 170 houses were destroyed. Although local authorities have been quick to respond, it is expected that displaced families will need relief supplies (food, health and non-food item kits) to get through the coming weeks. WFP is dispatching one ton of high energy biscuits and 35 tons of foodstuffs to the operational base in Mahajanga where a 500 ton-capacity warehouse is open to all humanitarian partners.  Agriculture is particularly affected by the floods in an area that was already struggling with a locust outbreak in the last months. Over 3,900 ha of rice fields have been submerged. In the medium term, there are concerns over the food security situation. An in-depth assessment by food partners is being planned.  The child protection network in Mahajanga deployed social workers to monitor temporary sites. So far no cases violence or exploitation have been reported and no children were separated from their parents. Information on the districts of Soalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy is currently being compiled following the aerial assessment. The Malagasy Red-Cross is also assessing the situation and is supporting displaced families and WASH activities. Additional pre-positioned Red Cross relief goods can be used in case needed following ongoing assessments.  As a result of funding constraints, a US$70,000 Emergency Cash Grant application has been submitted to OCHA, for logistical support to enable aerial assessments and provision of urgent relief items.  In Comoros, ongoing assessments by the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGSC) and the Red Crescent have to date found that around 8,800 people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Hellen.  In Anjouan, the poorest island in Comoros and the hardest hit, 7,869 people have been displaced, of which 6,142 are being hosted by relatives and 1,727 moved to 3 camps established at schools. An estimated 720 houses have been damaged and 180 houses destroyed. In Moheli, one death has been reported and 1,087 displaced people are being hosted by relatives. Three villages were flooded by storm surges and three others isolated by landslide. Electricity in some areas has still not been restored. In Grande Comores, roads have been damaged and houses flooded by a high tide. See attached map indicating impacts.  The situation is at this stage within the capacity of Government to respond. It is planning to dispatch over the next few days sufficient shelter and food supplies for those affected in Anjouan. Authorities have also started repairing roads. Other relief supplies are expected to be dispatched soon, with the assistance of UNICEF, which has also deployed a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialist to assist the Red Crescent in the management of the camps in Anjouan.  In Mozambique, according to the UN Resident Coordinator's Office, the heavy rains brought on by the system that eventually became Tropical Cyclone Hellen late last week affected an estimated 1,929 households (9,645 people) in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The affected districts are Quissanga, Balama, Montepuez, Metuge, Ibo, Mecufi, Mocimba de Praia, Nangada and Muidumbe; seven of which are inaccessible by road from Pemba (the provincial capital, which is also affected). Any humanitarian support will therefore have to be by sea or air.  Most affected households are staying with host families. Some accommodation centers have been opened in Pemba for extremely vulnerable families. The Government would prefer affected families to remain with host families as much as possible. The National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) is requesting the following humanitarian support via existing Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) structures:  400 tents for immediate shelter for families whose houses were completely destroyed;  100 tons of food to cover the food needs of those affected for a period of 1 month, including host families;  INGC is working to establish relocation communities to encourage people to leave the flood plains, for which it is requesting 600 shelter kits for families to start construction once an area has been identified in next couple days.  INGC will send a Mozambique Air Force plane to Pemba tomorrow to take three tons of food to cover immediate needs. WFP will mobilize trucks from Beira on 02 April with 160 tons of food and shelter kits from the NGO consortium COSACA. A full assessment will be carried out in the upcoming days, which will be joined by HCT partners. Authorities will be preparing damaged roads and bridges. The situation is under control and a plan is underway to support affected families.  The CCGC (Coordinating Council for Disaster Management) will meet tomorrow to make further decisions on the current situation and response in Cabo Delgado.

67,149,conflict,"IDMC bases its estimates on the Republic of Congo’s own government estimate, which was published in its Displaced Populations Report of March 2009. This is the latest source available  Up to 800,000 people in the Republic of the Congo – a quarter of the country’s population – were internally displaced during the 1990s by armed conflict in the Pool region between government forces and rebels originating from among the Lari ethnic group. The conflict ended in 2003, and by 2006, according to a government estimate, only 7,800 people remained displaced in Pool.  The figure’s most important limitation is that no new assessment of the number of IDPs has been conducted since 2009. Therefore, it is not known if IDPs have achieved durable solutions, leaving unanswered the question of whether internal displacement has really ended in the Republic of Congo.  The above figures do not include people displaced by slow-onset and sudden-onset natural hazards. In November 2012, for example, floods displaced an unknown number of people in Pointe-Noire, along Congo’s coast, and it is not known how many of those displaced have been able to return to their homes  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available.

Costa Rica’s National Meteorological Institute have warned that the heavy rainfall will continue.  Costa Rica’s National Emergency Commission (Comisión Nacional de Prevención de Riesgos y Atención de Emergencias – CNE) issued a red alert for parts of Heredia and Limón provinces.  Authorities say that the rain and flooding has forced a total of 1057 people to evacuate thier homes and move to one of the 13 temporary shelters set up by CNE, many of them in local community halls or churches. Most of those displaced are in the canton of Sarapiqui.  As of 07 July 2015, 94 communities across 15 cantons were facing access problems after roads had been flooded or damaged.  2 Weeks of Flooding  This latest period of heavy rain means that parts of Costa Rica have suffered flooding for over 2 weeks.

69,153,disaster,"  Current situation  Heavy rainfall in Eastern Croatia from 13-15 May 2014, has caused large-scale flooding with subsequent collapse of transit routes and evacuation of local population. In three days the precipitation levels have exceeded the average for three months. The floods forced the evacuation of, according to the latest data, 17,631 people. They are currently located in 6 collective centres in the adjacent region, as well as in many private homes of people who took them in. Further 36,000 people in Croatia are currently endangered by the floods. Over 17,000 school children are currently unable to attend school. There have been 2 casualties so far.  Until now, 4,367 housing units have been flooded and we anticipate that around 30% of them will need to be demolished because they will most likely have to be deemed unsuitable for habitation. Around 50% of all crops have been destroyed, and around 21,000 cattle have been evacuated from the flooded area. The most effected cities and municipalities are: Slavonski Brod, Municipality of Oriovac, Municipality of Slavonski Šamac, Municipality of Oprisavci, Municipality of Okučani and the wider area of Županja.  In the whole affected region (Croatia, B-H and Serbia), more than 100,000 homes, 230 schools, businesses, roads and railways were washed out by the flooding.  Croatia has been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in the flooded areas on its territory with its own capacities. However, in order to address the needs of the affected people and areas in the short-, medium- and long term, on 23 May 2014 the Government of Croatia has sent an appeal for international humanitarian assistance.  Response  Over 4000 officials and even a larger number of volunteers have been activated directly in activities related to rescue and protection. Furthermore, the Croatian Government has approved a programme of communal public works in order to contribute to the rehabilitation from the consequences of flooding. A minimal wage shall be paid to the people currently unemployed to join the programme.  All relevant line ministries have introduced measures for immediate relief, e.g. shelter, food and care for the displaced, books for the children, chemical (disinfection) and physical (removal of carcasses) decontamination of the area, feed for the evacuated cattle etc. In a coordinated effort, the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth, with the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence collected humanitarian aid from citizens and have sent in-kind assistance as well as monetary and psychosocial assistance to evacuated families.  Rapidly changing circumstances in the field, vastness of the flooded area, damage on the houses, other facilities, crops and cattle, threat of dislocated landmines and a large number of long-term displaced persons from Croatia, as well as from Bosnia and Hercegovina, along with continually arriving offers of assistance from our friends in the international community, prompted Croatia to issue a humanitarian appeal and ask for international assistance.  On 23 May 2014 Croatia has issued an international humanitarian appeal in order to effectively meet the needs of the affected population and regions. The international community has been informed about the concrete needs, most of which can in best way be covered by direct financial assistance. In general, we have been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in Croatia for food, shelter and medical care, as well as provide assistance to the neighbouring countries. However, we anticipate that in the medium- and long-term there will be a gap between the immediate relief and subsequent rehabilitation, reconstruction and development.  Currently, the water level has started to recede. All available forces for protection and rescue activities continue to work on strengthening the existing and in building new dikes, sharing food and water for vulnerable populations, rescuing survivors and disposing of animal carcasses. The situation remains complex due to landslides and road damages. State and local authorities are engaged in on-going evacuation efforts.  Thorough analysis of the current situation in affected areas has already begun as well as a breakdown of necessary activities and tasks for the forthcoming period. Even though water levels have begun to recede there is a fear for new disasters since the area is contaminated with landmines and other non-exploded remnants of war. Due to the flooding the landmines may have been dislocated outside the previously marked locations, which make the subsequent assessment of the damage, clearing and the reconstruction of the flooded areas even more delicate and dangerous. The cleaning of landmines in two municipalities of Gunja and Vrbanja is estimated at the cost of 4 million euros. In order to find a regional solution for this sensitive issue Croatia is communicating with experts from Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia.  Furthermore, we are facing the rising threat of mosquitos in the flooded areas in all three countries. This problem will be resolved regionally with the assistance of the EU. Overall sanitary decontamination of the area is also a precondition for further steps. Another pressing issue is to provide longer-term shelter in form of air-conditioned containers for the displaced people until their homes will be dried and reconstructed.  CONCRETE NEEDS  Bearing in mind a constant change of circumstances affecting the needs-assessment, the possibility of more effective utilisation of capacities otherwise needed for coordination, transport, storage and dissemination of in-kind assistance, and the potential mobilisation of our own resources (e.g. in the field of demining), in order to adequately, effectively and sustainably respond to the catastrophe, financial assistance would be the preferred alternative of support, without prejudice to other kinds of assistance offered.  Croatian assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia  Croatia extended aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia comprising of financial means, goods and manpower. The Croatian Government has provided financial assistance in the amount of 200,000 euros, to the Bosnian and Serbian Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We are accommodating displaced people from Bosnia and Hercegovina (currently about 500) which are crossing the border and looking for refuge in Eastern Croatia.  To Bosnia and Hercegovina we sent 2 helicopters, 9 motor boats, 15 vehicles, civil protection team, fire-fighters, divers and policemen totalling 52 people. They have evacuated and saved more than 1,000 people. 90,000 sand bags have been delivered.  To the most endangered municipalities in Serbia, we sent 4 divers and 2 policemen. After having finished the operations in Eastern Croatia, we pledged to send 2 motorboats, 5 vehicles, one civil protection unit and one firefighting team, in total 15 personnel. A water purification system has been offered.

The government of Cyprus continues to register IDPs on the basis of identity cards given to people who, at the time of the Turkish invasion:  lived in the northern part of the island, that later declared itself as the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (TRNC);  had a permanent residence in areas under the control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus because of their profession but their house and/or their property was in areas controlled by TRNC;  temporarily lived abroad due to professional obligations that arose while they resided in Cyprus.  Moreover, descendants of people with the identity card are also eligible to receive such identity cards and to be recognised as IDPs (GoC).  Displacement occurred in 1974 as groups backed by Greece’s military junta ousted the Cypriot leader, and Turkey sent troops to the island in response. As a result, Greek Cypriots fled to the south, while Turkish Cypriots fled to the north. In both cases, thousands of people were forced from their homes, suffered significant loss and needed large-scale assistance.  Turkish Cypriots live in the TRNC, only recognized by Turkey. In 1975, following the Vienna III Agreement, the TRNC declared that the internal displacement situation was over, and the residents were given the option to move with[IS1] in TRNC with assistance, or to remain where they were with protection guarantees. Since that time the “TRNC” has not granted displaced status or benefits to people displaced to TRNC (IDMC, 20 June 2009).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available.

Kinshasa  BBC and Reuters are both reporting that severe flooding in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital has left dozens dead since late November.  Emmanuel Akweti, the local minister for the capital’s inner city, told the BBC that around 20 people have died since 29 November.  Reuters report that at least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  Many of the deaths have occurred in communities living along or close the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili.  Local media, including Radio Okapi, have reported that the flooding worsened after a weekend of heavy rain which prompted rivers to overflow. Many have been forced from their homes. Those displaced are currently living along roadsides in the city, or have found refuge in churches, schools or other public buildings.  The floods have left many without drinking water after the Regideso water treatment plant was affected. Regideso said that the shortage of drinking water will affect 17 districts of eastern and central Kinshasa.  The rain is still falling and the flood situation could worsen. WMO report that 72 mm of rain was recorded in Kinshasa in a 24 hour period between 08 and 09 December 2015.

Bumba in Mongala District is thought to have been one of the worst hit areas, where local Red Cross officials say almost 400 houses have been destroyed. Floods have blocked importation supply routes in particular in south east parts of Équateur province. Radio Okapi say that, according to their sources, these floods are the strongest seen in the Central Basin since 1997.

The deaths since Nov. 17, concentrated in neighbourhoods along the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili, have resulted mainly from home collapses, Emmanuel Akweti said.  The flooding has made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing two-thirds of Kinshasa's communes from accessing drinkable water, he added.  An employee at the public water utility said officials hoped to resume service there by Thursday.  Kinshasa, a sprawling city of more than 10 million people, has notoriously poor infrastructure, with improvised wooden shacks lining the waterfront and dirt roads that often flood with the first rainfall.  Akweti said that precipitation levels this rainy season - which runs from October to April - were unusually high with Kinshasa registering 450 millimetres (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between Nov. 17 and Dec. 6 alone.  He warned that weather forecasters were predicting above average rainfall through to February and urged all residents living in riverside areas to evacuate.  Congo's government has invested considerably in Kinshasa's infrastructure in recent years, but critics complain that the upgrades have almost exclusively targeted the city's upscale neighbourhoods and prominent landmarks.

93,183,disaster,"Enrique Guevara in Panama    Heavy rain is not a new phenomenon in Andean region of South America. But despite the serious disruption the rains often cause to the lives and livelihoods of thousands, their ‘regularity’ means they’re often under-reported or fail to capture greater public attention.    In early 2012 Ecuador was hit by a series of intense storms causing floods, burst riverbanks and landslides. Volunteers from the Ecuadorian Red Cross immediately took action in the worst-hit provinces to rescue and evacuate affected people, provide pre-hospital care and psychosocial support, and assess the extent of the damage and needs.    Teresa Basurto is a mother of three. Her youngest son is 14 and studies over 300km from his home in La Armenia; her two older boys have married and left home. When a fierce storm hit the district, Teresa’s home was flooded and she lost her rice crops, chickens and pigs – her three main sources of income for the family.    Fortunately her home, made from cane and a zinc roof, withstood the battering but she was warned to stay away during the worst of the weather due to a risk of more flooding. A short period of evacuation, in which Teresa stayed with family, turned into a month and a half away from home.    Teresa remembers that the situation got worse because that she did not have a job, but with the help of friends who gave her rice seeds she was able to work again. Regaining this source of income was vital and allowed her to buy cured rice and use it as seed.    Teresa’s experience is far from unique. The National Secretariat for Risk Management in Ecuador says the storm affected over 121,000 people. More than 7,340 people had to evacuate their homes to stay in shelters or with family members. The floods damaged or destroyed homes, schools, roads, bridges and other crucial infrastructure.    With support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and funding from the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the Ecuadorian Red Cross provided food assistance and hygiene kits and, spread messages on disease prevention and health promotion among families in the coastal provinces of Manabi, Los Rios and Guayas.    The effects of the storms on agriculture have a significant impact on a community’s ability to recover. Rodolfo Carriel is a farmer who lives in Bebo in the district of Salitre. He is a veteran of many floods, but the severity of the disaster in 2012 took him by surprise.    When the storm hit, Rodolfo was in the Community Committee of Salitre and responded to the emergency with friends from the Committee. A 20 meter wall collapsed causing a massive flood which left his family with no rice crops, no animals and a patch of land incapable of supporting his work. The family was devastated. “We were almost left homeless,” he says.    Along with emergency assistance, the Ecuadorian Red Cross also began preparing the communities for the risk of waterborne diseases such as dengue that can sometimes arise after significant flooding. “I feel very thankful because the help arrived just when we needed it,” Rodolfo says.    Teresa fears that if this year’s floods are as bad, the communities will not be fully prepared, but at least, through programmes supported by the Ecuadorian Red Cross, IFRC and ECHO, they are aware of the risks and know some of the things they can do to lessen the impact.",http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/americas/ecuador/silent-disasters-floods-bring-additional-challenges-to-vulnerable-communities-in-ecuador-60844/,en

96,190,conflict,"Egypt has complied with international human rights law and has consulted with local residents while combating terrorism in Sinai, Egypt's new cabinet said in a press statement on Tuesday.  The statement, which sums up the efforts of the Egyptian government in Sinai over the past two years, said that residents subject to compulsory evacuation in North Sinai were surveyed to find out their preferred method of compensation.  The cabinet's statement came on the same day Human Rights Watch claimed that ""the mass home demolitions and forced eviction of about 3,200 families in the Sinai Peninsula …violated international law.""  The US-based rights watchdog said in a report that Egypt can ""certainly protect itself from the insurgency and take action against the insurgents’ supply lines…in a way that does not arbitrarily harm civilians and violate their right to housing and their protections during forced evictions.”  For the past two years, Egypt has been combating a spike in a decade-long Islamist militant insurgency in North Sinai.  As part of its strategy to eliminate terrorism, the government evicted over 1,000 families and destroyed many houses, with the aim of creating a 1km-deep buffer zone along Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip.  Egyptian forces have also been destroying underground tunnels between Gaza and Egypt, which they say are used by militants to smuggle weapons into Egypt.  The cabinet statement added that the majority of the surveyed citizens who were evicted from their homes to create the buffer zone wanted their compensation in the form of cash, while a minority preferred replacement land and housing.  The infrastructure of New Rafah, designed to replace the parts of the city of Rafah which were demolished to create the buffer zone, is currently being completed to absorb all those citizens who want to move there, the statement added.  The statement also said that security forces adhered to “the principle of not opening fire on a potential threat unless the source of threat imminently threatens security forces.""  Human Rights Watch argued that, based on interviews with North Sinai citizens, Egyptian authorities had ""provided residents with little or no warning of the evictions and no effective way to challenge their eviction, home demolition, or compensation.""  The Human Rights Watch report also argues that Egypt has failed to use sophisticated tunnel-detecting technology, on which Egyptian personnel have been trained by the United States, in order to find and eliminate tunnels without destroying as many homes and buildings.  Cairo has repeatedly called Human Rights Watch's reports on the post-Morsi situation in Egypt biased.

The rains on Sunday and Monday flooded 35 acres of agricultural land in 15 different village in Asyut and displaced hundreds of citizens since the floods destroyed the dams previously built by the army forces in Wady Al-Sheikh.  Secretary of education Directorate of Asyut said that 99 schools were suspended, which left 28,000 students at their homes in the governorate, because of the floods.  Asyut governor General Ibrahim Hammad visited the affected areas to make sure that there are no human losses. He will coordinate with Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, promising to compensate the affected houses and agricultural lands.  There was an accident in Asyut on Thursday night when two vehicles collided due to the remnant water, mud puddles, and high speed. Twenty passengers died and two were injured on the Cairo – Asyut desert road.  “There will be appropriate will to those affected by the floods,” Hammad said on Monday evening during his phone interview on CBC Extra channel.  Hamad said the damages are yet to be determined, stressing that many areas in Asyut are now suffering due to the floods, especially in the Wady Al-Sheikh district.  No causalities were reported up until now and government will compensate people who lost their houses or lands, Hamad emphasized.  In Luxor, 147 houses were affected by the floods, most of them with cracks in the ceiling, according to Governor of Luxor Alaa Al-Harass. Some civil societies managed to provide immediate aid for those affected by the floods, mostly with rations and blankets.  Governor of North Sinai Khaled Fouda said the international road was opened again on Monday after suspension due to the floods since rocks and sand were falling on it because of the rains. Youm7 reported the collapse of four houses and some sidelines in the governorate.  In Sohag , Youm7 reported that small dams collapsed in 1994, which were built only with rocks with no cement. They violate the technical standards, which is why they were not able to resist the floods which affected agricultural lands and homes in the governorate.  Governor of Sohag Mahmoud Ateeq said that floods caused three cuts in the Sohag – Red Sea bridge as a result of torrential rain and the rush of severe floods, adding that the road gates are closed until they are completely repaired.  In the Red Sea governorate, roads were flooded and vehicles traffic was suspended in the road from Raas Ghareb to Hurghada for 15 kilometers. Hurghada International Airport witnessed a crisis when an electricity blackout due to leaked water from the ceiling.  Nine were killed and 35 injured in a bus accident in Hurghada on Saturday due to the bad weather.

Mahlab assigned the Arab contractors company to find engineering solutions to prevent the accumulation of rain water in tunnels in priority areas, which causes traffic congestion.  Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdul Muttalib ended his visit to Uganda prematurely after one. He came back to Egypt to follow up on the situation in the affected governorates.

Here the levels of the River Agly were so high, forecasters feared they would reach the levels of the worst floods on 1999. Flooding was so bad in March 2013 that a woman motorist was killed near Perpignan as her car was swept away by the flood waters of the river. About 700 residents were evacuated from their homes in the area at the foot of the Pyrenees. Flooding also hit the Rhone Valley in south east France.

110,215,disaster,"Violent storms and flooding send water cascading through Antibes, Cannes and Nice, inundating a retirement home and killing three people inside  Nineteen people are feared dead after violent storms and severe flooding swept the French Riviera, including three people who drowned in a retirement home after a river broke its banks.    Heavy flooding along the Côte d’Azur on Saturday saw the river Brague burst its banks close to the city of Antibes, flooding a home for elderly people.  The French president, François Hollande, confirmed at least 16 people had died and three were missing. The interior ministry said earlier in the morning there was little hope of finding the missing people alive.  “It’s not over,” Hollande said as he arrived at the flooded retirement home and met emergency service workers. “The toll is not yet finalised. In times like this, we must be fast, efficient and coordinated.” He warned locals to take care on local roads, which are covered with slippery mud.  At least seven people drowned after their cars became trapped in underground car parks, according to rescue teams in Mandelieu-la Napoule, with the commune’s mayor, Henri Leroy, warning more bodies may be found.  “It’s apocalyptic,” he told Agence France-Presse. “The parking was half-emptied but there are thousands of vehicles. There could be more bodies.”  Three people drowned when their car became stuck in rising waters inside a narrow tunnel near Vallauris Golfe-Juan, authorities said.  A woman in her 60s is reported to have died in the street in Cannes when huge storms hit the region on Saturday. Water and debris coursed down roads in the festival town and in the neighbouring city of Nice. Another victim was found dead at a campsite in Antibes, according to officials.  More than 17cm (6.7in) of rain fell on the Cannes region in two hours, radio France Bleu Azur reported.  Obama declares state of emergency in South Carolina over floods Read more  Guardian journalist Stuart Dredge, attending the MIPJunior television conference in Cannes, said the venue for the event had been flooded. He said he had walked knee-deep in water on his way home on Saturday night after watching the England-Australia Rugby World Cup match.  “By half time, the street outside was running with water, and the main Rue d’Antibes road in Cannes was between ankle and knee-deep at its lower points,” he said.  “The crossroads were the most dangerous parts: the water really was pouring down from the higher ground with strong currents – and a fair few people walking home had been drinking, so their balance would have been a bit impaired already.”  Stuart Dredge (@stuartdredge) Seriously though, this is the state of Cannes' main thoroughfare right now pic.twitter.com/xk2V429l9X  Dredge said he did not see anyone fall into the water, although some moped drivers needed assistance. “This morning, there are a few cars that have clearly been swept along and deposited leaning against railings. When I got home the power was out in my building, but it came back on again shortly before midnight.  “I think Cannes probably got off lightly, comparably. It was a hairy walk home, but I didn’t feel in true danger,” he added.  Flooding in Cannes  “Some cars were carried off into the sea,” said Cannes’ mayor, David Lisnard, describing water levels reaching halfway up car doors and trees left uprooted on the city’s main street.    “We have rescued a lot of people, and we must now be vigilant against looting,” he added, announcing that an emergency plan to mobilise police, emergency responders and municipal services.  British journalist Sarah Kovandzich said she was in Le Crillon bar a few streets back from the seafront when she and her companions saw water running past the door.  “I’ve never seen anything like it in Cannes,” she said. “The water started to seep into the bar, then we were up to our ankles, people were putting their feet up on the chairs. Outside, you could see plant pots and flowers just being carried along the road by the water.”  Kovandzich said the walk home was daunting because the flooding had removed manhole covers. “You couldn’t immediately see where the holes might be because of the flowing water.”  The power was out in her apartment and water was dripping through the ceiling, she said.  One social media user compared the scenes in Cannes on Sunday morning to the zombie TV series The Walking Dead, posting pictures of several damaged cars.  Jer Crunchant ™ (@jercrunchant) Les rues de #Cannes ont un air de ""The Walking Dead"" ce matin, sauf que ce n'est pas de la fiction #jamaisvuca pic.twitter.com/dFACFwtM0Q  France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, was also due to visit the area on Sunday morning to inspect rescue efforts, his spokesman said.  Hollande thanked rescuers and politicians for their work, praising the “solidarity of the nation” and offering condolences to the victims’ families, while the prime minister, Manuel Valls, spoke of his “deep emotion” on hearing of the deaths.  The Elysée palace announced on Sunday that victims of the flooding will receive help from the state under a French law that gives compensation to victims of natural disasters. A tweet from the president’s office said it would be paid within three months.  The areas worst hit by flooding were also the hardest to access, officials said, raising fears the death toll could rise. About 27,000 homes remained without power early on Sunday, 14,000 of them in Cannes.  French rail company SNCF said about a dozen trains carrying hundreds of people had to be halted for safety reasons, while roads around Antibes were also flooded, according to French emergency services. Train services are still cancelled between Toulon and Nice, a spokesman said on Sunday, adding that further delays are likely.  “Campsites are under water, and two helicopters are circling to ensure the public’s security, as some people are stuck on the roof of their caravans,” said a spokeswoman for the fire brigade.  Up to 500 tourists, including several Britons and Danes, sought shelter overnight at Nice airport, while a Nice versus Nantes football match was interrupted by the downpours.  French weather forecasters said the worst storms had now passed over the French mainland and were heading for the Italian coast.  More than 120 people are staying in temporary shelters in Cannes, according to city authorities. Donations for those who have lost belongings in the floods are being organised in an emergency drive by French charity Secours Populaire.",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/heavy-flooding-in-french-riviera-leaves-more-than-a-dozen-people-dead,en

113,218,disaster,"Period covered by this update:  26 July – 2 August 2013  Summary: On 25th July 2013, CHF 121,847 CHF was initially allocated from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Georgia Red Cross Society in delivering immediate assistance to 380 families (1900 beneficiaries). Due to the continuation of the adverse weather conditions and newly arisen needs, however, the National Society has now revised its operational plans together with its budget. The revised total budget for this operation amounts to CHF 215,194. Based on the most recent needs assessment, a total of 680 families (3400 beneficiaries) will thus be targeted throughout Georgia. Unearmarked funds to repay DREF are encouraged.  On 19th and few days later, on 29th July 2013, extended heavy rains caused considerable damages in several parts of Georgia. A total of 4,800 families (24,000 people) have been affected in the following regions Samegrelo, Guria, Ajara, Mtskheta - Mtianeti. The western part of Georgia was the most affected. In Samegrelo region more than 20 villages and Senaki town were severely affected by the floods.  Houses, agricultural lands, gardens and yards were flooded. Cattle and poultry were killed. Cracks appeared in walls of the houses and traffic movement was severely affected. Heavy rain also significantly affected eastern part of Georgia, as well: seven villages of Dusheti municipality were isolated from the outside world and more than 20 villages were severely affected. The amount of inflicted damage is being assessed.  Based on the initial needs assessed and on the official request for support for Zugdidi municipality, Senaki town in Samegrelo region and Dusheti municipality in Mtskheta-Mtianeti region GRCS is planning to assist 13 villages (250 families) in Zugdidi Municipality, 300 families in Senaki town and 7 villages (130 families) in Dusheti Municipality.  The Georgia Red Cross Society is now aiming to assist 680 families (3,400 beneficiaries) with food and non-food items (NFI), i.e. food parcels, mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, and hygiene kits. This operation is expected to be implemented over three months, and will therefore be completed by 1 November 2013; the Final Report will be made available three months after the end of the operation (by 1 February 2014).",http://reliefweb.int/report/georgia/georgia-flash-floods-mdrge007-dref-operation-update-1,en
114,220,conflict,"The estimate is a composite of figures reported by the government of Georgia, UNHCR, and the UN Inter-Agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia.  The government reported in December 2014 that it had registered 262,704 people as IDPs. This number is based on results from a re-registration exercise conducted in 2013-2014 by the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees. The figure is a slight increase from the initial figure released after the re-registration exercise for two reasons. First, some IDPs failed to participate in the re-registration process in 2013 and consequently had their status terminated. They are now gradually approaching the Ministry in order to re-register and have their statuses restored. Second, children with one IDP parent are entitled to the status. Each month about 400-500 newborns receive the status, which causes an increase in the IDP figure.  Most IDPs were displaced in the early 1990s as a result of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while a smaller number were displaced during conflict with the Russian Federation over South Ossetia in August 2008.  The number of IDPs registered by the government includes people who have returned home to Abkhazia, but does not include people displaced within Abkhazia and South Ossetia. No official survey has been conducted there by the Georgian authorities as these regions are not under its control.  The IDMC estimate of 232,700 internally displaced is arrived at by:  deducting from the official government figure of 262,704  At least 45,000 IDPs who have spontaneously returned to Abkhazia (UNHCR, 31 July 2009)  and adding:  Some 5,000 IDPs still displaced within South Ossetia as a result of the 1991-1992 conflict (UN HRC, 14 January 2010)  At least 10,000 IDPs in South Ossetia displaced due to the 2008 conflict (United Nations Inter-agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia, 2008).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.",http://www.internal-displacement.org/europe-the-caucasus-and-central-asia/georgia/figures-analysis,en

More than 60 firefighters and volunteers, supported by dozens of fire engines, four aircraft and four helicopters, battled flames that spread on several fronts.

116,225,disaster,"Last update: February 5, 2014 at 5:11 pm by By  Earthquake-report.com is a independent NGO website who only survives because of (mostly small) PRIVATE DONATIONS. Your gift will be highly appreciated. This page will automatically refresh every 30 minutes as we might be adding updates (mostly, but not exclusively for earthquakes with a damaging potential). Keep it open in a browser tab.  –  Update February 5 :  A scientific team, including 100 engineers along with seismologists and engineers from the Technical Chamber of Greece, have already come to the island to inspect all public buildings. According to first estimates, around 600 buildings are deemed demolished, 1,100 heavy damaged and 1,400 with minor damage throughout the region of Palliki while there are several problems in public infrastructure such as roads, ports and public buildings that need restoration.  Update Jan. 27, 10:33 UTC: Seven people suffered minor injuries due to falling objects, officials said. More than 2000 people (temporarily) had to leave their damaged houses.  Update 19:20 UTC: The strong aftershock was also felt in parts of Albania (Tirana) and Italy. A second quake, M 4.2, followed at 19:12 UTC.  Update 19:12 UTC: The revised data from greek authorities say the aftershock had M 5.2. Stong enough to cause new damage and make the night even more uncomfortable. Another shock, M 4.2, followed 15 minutes later. (More Info about the aftershock here)  Update 19:09 UTC: News from the mainshock: At least 2 people are confirmed to be slightly injured. They went to the hospital in Argostoli. Due to the damage caused to tis hospital, mainly to its roof, it was decided to evacuate it. Patients were transferred to the next wooden building.  Update 18:56 UTC: The new quake (aftershock), happening at 18:45 UTC, is specified with Magnitude 4.9 by greek authorities (preliminary data).  Update 18:48 UTC: A new quake, preliminary M 5.6, happened a few minutes ago!  Update 17:59 UTC: Schools across Cephalonia will be closed Monday in order for the necessary verifications of the building structures to be made.  Update 16:59 UTC: Nearly every building in Lixouri suffered at least minor damage. Many buildings, esspecially pubic buildings like schools, show severe damage like collapsed walls and roofs. Other places on Cephalonia, for example the airport, are also affected. Authorities are working to organize a save supply of food and water for the earthquake victims. Most of them won't return to their homes and stay outside during the coming night.  Update 16:48 UTC: Some people are treated in the hospital of Argostoli for minor injuries, mainly caused by falling objects / debris and broken glass.  Update 15:44 UTC: One house in Kounopetra collapsed, luckily without affecting people. An relatively large ash emission of the volcano Etna on Sicily (Italy) followed shortly after this quake was felt there. A connection of both events is possible.  Update 15:18 UTC: Also the neighbour island Zakynthos (south of Cephalonia) reports minor damage to buildings, mainly broken windows.  Update 15:04 UTC: The greek Secretary of Interior is going to visit the earthquake area later today. Newspapers report that Lixouri is the most affected area. Many houses there suffered damage in diverse extent. No injuries or collapsed houses so far, but the quake also caused rockfalls and minor landslides in parts of the island!  Update 14:53 UTC: Power supply is interrupted in Fiskardo, located in northern Cephalonia. More damage reports coming in from different parts of the Island, so far ""only"" bricks falling from walls, cracks and other limited damage, but it seems that several buildings are affected. In Lixouri a hospice and some homes were demolished.  Update 14:48 UTC: Damaged buildings are reported from Lixouri, located only 6 km from the epicenter. No details about the damage are available yet.  Update 14:37 UTC: First reports mentioning cracked roads and a chaotic situation on Cephalonia. Most people were frightened by the earthquake and ran to the streets. Fire brigade and police are checking for possible damaged buildings and injuries.  Update 14:33 UTC: So far, 2 aftershocks with M 4.1 and 4.2 were registered. More are expected to follow. People on Cephalonia should be prepared for it. Residents of Kefalonia are scared. This event reminded them about the great earthquake of 1953 (M 7.2), where hundreds of people lost their lives.  Update 14:29 UTC: The magnitude was revised to 5.8. A shallow depth of only 17 km is given by greek authorities. Quakes with this magnitude and shallow depth happening in populated locations can cause heavy damage, esspecially to buildings with poor construction.  Update 14:21 UTC: People report the shaking also from distant countries, like Albania, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Southern Italy.  A strong quake with magnitude 5.7 shook the greek island Cephalonia a few minutes ago. The shocks were also felt in Athens. The epicenter is located in the western part of the island.

117,229,disaster,"A landslide caused by recent heavy rain has prompted disaster management authorities in Guatemala to evacuate over 300.  The landslide occurred during the morning of Saturday, 11 July 2015, in the municipality of Chinautla, in the department of Guatemala. The country’s disaster management agency, CONRED, say that the landslide completely destroyed 10 houses and damaged 11 others. A further 49 homes are thought to be at risk, prompting CONRED to evacuate 350 people in total.  Around 46 of those displaced are currently staying in a local community hall, while the rest have found temporary accommodation with family or friends.  No deaths or injuries have been reported. CONRED have distributed blankets and sleeping mats, hygiene kits and clean water to those affected by the landslide.  More Rain Forecast  Guatemala’s meteorological department INSIVUMEH said that northern areas of the country could see more than 40mm of rain in the next 24 hours. Currently three rivers or lakes in the northern Petén Department are above normal maximum levels: Río La Pasión, Lago Petén Itzá, and Rìo Usumacinta.  INSIVUMEH also warned that further heavy rainfall is likely from Wednesday 15 July, especially in southern and central regions.  Heavy rain across parts of central America over the last 2 weeks has also affected Nicaragua where the Escondido river has overflowed in El Rama, and Costa Rica, where over 1,000 people have been evacuated after over 2 weeks of flooding.",http://floodlist.com/america/350-evacuated-after-heavy-rain-causes-landslide-in-guatemala.  ,en
118,234,conflict,"This figure includes 242,000 IDPs who were displaced during the civil conflict. This specific number is based upon estimates published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1997. Since then, updated figures on internal displacement have not been gathered at the country level.  The government pledged to address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs within its general anti-poverty interventions. However, at the end of 2007 the government had not agreed on criteria to include IDPs in a national reparation programme and it is unclear how many people can still be considered as displaced, if any.  The total figure, however, does not take into account organized groups of displaced people, nor it includes disaster-induced displacement figure, which as of December 2013 was of 93 IDPs who were displaced by an earthquake.  Displacement is a result of the conflict that opposed the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity armed group. Between 1981 and 1983 when violence reached its most critical stage, the Guatemalan government launched operations tierra arrasada (“obliterated earth”), which meant to massacre entire communities in order to eliminate potential cooperation between the armed groups and their social base. As a consequence massive displacements occurred. The conflict towards 1997, after the signature of several peace agreements, and left between 500,000 and 1.5 million people displaced, most of them indigenous.  Many of the country’s IDPs have returned or resettled in areas where they live under similar conditions as before they were displaced. Many face extreme poverty and marginalisation.  In addition, there is evidence of new displacement caused by organized crime, street gangs and maras, as well as other territorial conflicts associated with illegal resources exploitation and land appropriation. Although there are no official figures about these new displacements, there is evidence of forced evictions carried out in 2011.  Furthermore, drug trafficking organisations and gangs seeking strategic territory in order to extract palm oil and smuggle merchandise through the border, forcibly displaced 470 families from Peten. In total, the press reported that 350 families have been displaced by violence.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.",http://www.internal-displacement.org/americas/guatemala/figures-analysis,en

Photo Credit: MINUSTAH  Port-au-Prince - Haiti’s Department of Civil Protection in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has been working non-stop to assist flood-affected families in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains, floods and landslides that killed 17 people, five of them children. More than 15,000 houses were flooded, 90 were destroyed and 800 were severely damaged. Over 6,500 people are temporarily housed in emergency shelters.  The recent floods have also affected over 2,200 hectares of crops in one of the country’s most fertile areas.  “This hurricane season is nearly over and has been relatively mild in Haiti, but the recent storms have once again showed the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters,” said UNDP Haiti Senior Country Director Sophie de Caen, adding that UNDP and the UN family have been immediately working with the Government to mobilize resources and provide support to the most affected populations.  ”However, these floods actually showed that Haiti is strengthening its disaster prevention capacity: as a result of UNDP’s work to improve Haiti’s Civil Protection Department and its effectiveness, the response to the recent floods was entirely led by national authorities.”  Moreover, around 40 UNDP experts work directly with the Government and its Emergency Operation Centers at the national and local levels.  To mitigate the impact of floods and other natural disasters, UNDP and the Haitian Government have also planted close to nine million trees and worked with farmers to plant more resistant crops that prevent erosion. In addition, flood mitigation measures have been improved, using watershed management tools and protecting riverbanks.  “It is clear that the Government’s recent efforts with its partners—including UNDP—to boost resilience, particularly in the north and northeastern areas, are a step in the right direction,” de Caen said.",http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2014/11/12/undp-government-of-haiti-provide-immediate-support-to-flood-affected-victims/,en
121,240,disaster,"Local authorities say that Nicaragua and Honduras have experienced heavy rainfall during the first two weeks of June, causing floods which have left a total of 8 people dead and 2 missing.  Nicaragua  In Nicaragua, the disaster management agency, Sistema Nacional para la Prevención, Mitigación y Atención de Desastres (SINAPRED), say that heavy rain between 02 and 14 June has left 6 people dead, and affected 35,350 in 7,041 households. As of 15 June, there were 129 families displaced by the floods and severe weather, most of them in Managua municipality. The families are currently being housed in shelters or temporary accommodation.  The heavy rain and ensuing floods have affected 11 departments of the country – Managua, Madriz, Carazo, Nueva Segovia, León, Matagalpa, Masaya, Chinandega, Esteli, Granada and the North Caribbean Coast Region.  According to SINAPRED figures, 6,975 homes have been flooded over the last 2 weeks, with at least 22 homes have been completely destroyed, and a further 44 severely damaged. Two schools have been destroyed in the floods, with 10 other schools damaged.  Landslide Warnings  On Monday 15 June, the heavy rain prompted SINAPRED to issue landslide warnings for those living in communities near the volcanoes in the country.  Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez, Co Director SINAPRED, said that the slopes of active volcanoes, including San Cristobal, Telica Momotombo and Concepción, as well as inactive volcanoes such as Casitas, Santa Clara, Mombacho and Maderas, have been made unstable by the heavy rains, increasing the possibility of sudden landslides which could cause damage to crops and infrastructure and the loss of human lives.  Given that such landslides can occur suddenly, Dr. Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to give effective early warnings. He recommended those in vulnerable areas refer to hazard maps produced by Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) to assess the conditions of the communities most at risk.  Honduras  Local media in Honduras are reporting that the country has also been badly affected by heavy rain and resulting floods over the last few days.  As of 15 June 2015, at least two people have died and another two are missing, over 500 have been affected and over 115 homes have been damaged.

125,245,disaster,"3.6 million people affected. Over 45,000 houses damaged. Poorest are the worst hit.  North, central and coastal districts of Odisha are facing massive floods since August 5, 2014 due to the rise in the waters of the rivers Mahanadi, Baitarani, Budhabalanga, Subarnarekha and their tributaries. Release of excess water from dams in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and incessant rains worsened the situation.  Worst hit:  Jajpur, Puri, Bhadhrak, Kendrapara and Cuttack.  Evacuations:  Government deployed 11 battalions of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 30 battalions of Odisha State Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF). Rescue operations were completed on August 9, 2014.  Oxfam’s team carried out a rapid assessment in the worst affected Jajpur and Puri districts, where most of the villages are still submerged 15 ft deep, 8 out of 10 blocks in Jajpur and 6 out of 11 blocks in Puri district are still cut off and can be reached only via boats.  709,841 people displaced in Jajpur and 363,832 in Puri district.  Over 366,541 hectares of farm land is under water and the paddy crop has been destroyed.  Over 45,953 houses are damaged and will need reconstruction.  The floods have impacted 1.13 million livestock.  Families took shelter in school buildings, Panchayat Ghar (village meeting halls) and on higher grounds. Many are living on embankments in make shift shelters with their families and livestock. The food and financial security of the agrarian community has been impacted for a long term. With inadequate availability of drinking water supply, poor sanitation facilities and risky hygiene practices, there are high chances of worsening of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) situation in the affected areas.  Disease:  Due to the lack of immediate healthcare, cases of diarrhea, fever, common cold, fungal infections are now being reported. There are many 0-5 year old children, lactating and pregnant women who need immediate medical attention.  Food security and nutrition:  Many from displaced communities are landless daily wage labourers with no work available at the moment. The Scheduled Caste (SC) communities in the affected villages are worst hit and have no access to food, livelihood, shelter and WaSH. They are relying 100% on government relief for food.  Poor Living Conditions:  Temporary shelters close to each other, people share this space on the embankment with their livestock. Some are living on road sides, high lands and on roof tops of concrete houses almost marooned in the flood waters. They are living in shelters made wood frames and tarpaulin.  Water and Sanitation:  The flood water has contaminated the tube wells, ponds and other water sources.  Schools:  Education of children from primary school is disrupted the buildings have been converted to a temporary relief shelter in Jajpur district. In Puri, school buildings are still submerged in flood water  Government Relief:  Food aid was available for ten days when 243 free community kitchens fed over 86,330 populations with cooked food. State government mobilized 77,856 quintals of rice, 5,221 quintals of flattened rice, 404 quintals of jiggery and 1,606 polythene rolls as emergency relief. Frontline health workers were mobilised by the health department to provide water disinfecting halogen tablets, ORS packets, anti-fungal and anti-diarrheal drugs. A government survey of damage of shelter and crop is yet to start.  Map of Assessed Areas      Dasarathpur block of Jajpur district was caught unawares, as this area is protected from flooding by the embankment. The people were not prepared for the flood, the first in 50 years, and therefore do not have sufficient coping mechanisms. Many have been displaced and are now housed in emergency shelters at schools and GP Offices. Many schools are non functional as many of them are being used as shelters while some are still submerged.  Dasratpur Block residents evacuated their villages and moved to embankments along with their livestock. All low-lying areas and crop fields of the assessed villages were submerged under water. Only means of access available to Rapid Assessment team were boats provided by the administration and NGOs. But the frequency of availability of boats within the villages is low, limiting the mobility of the community to access basic amenities at block level. The block administration has provided only one boat in Kanas block of Puri district and 21 boats in Jajpur district.  Most of the households do not have food grains and are dependent on relief received from government, which is minimal. A few local community leaders are providing some food aid. In few villages, local community based organisations are also supporting those affected with cooked food.",http://www.oxfamindia.org/subpage/238,en
126,247,disaster,"Villagers with their belongings sit in a relief camp after their evacuation at Supaul district in Bihar August 3, 2014. REUTERS/Krishna Murari Kishan  BHUBANESHWAR(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - About 30,000 evacuated villagers in Bihar began returning home on Tuesday after the threat of floods due to a landslide in neighbouring Nepal eased, but 100,000 remained in relief camps, government officials said.  The landslide, triggered by heavy rains in Nepal's Sindhupalchowk district on Saturday, killed at least 33 people and created a mud dam blocking the Sunkoshi river, which flows into India as the Kosi river.  Indian authorities, fearing a torrent of water as the Nepalese army tried to clear the landslide, evacuated more than 130,000 villagers in Bihar over the weekend.  A senior disaster management official said the careful clearing of the landslide across the border had lessened the risk of flash floods and 30,000 evacuees were told to return home.  ""Some of the districts … in the downstream area such as Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria and Bhagalpur, they may not face the problems anticipated earlier,"" said Vyasji, principal secretary of Bihar disaster management department.  ""We have stopped our evacuation process in these four districts. People who are at the relief camps have been told to go back to their villages,"" he told Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Patna, Bihar's main city.  But the districts of Supaul, Saharsa and Madhepura remained on high alert, Vyasji added, and around 100,000 people were still sheltering in relief camps.  Both India and Nepal have monitored the Kosi river closely since it broke its banks in 2008 and changed its course, killing more than 500 people, submerging swathes of land and affecting more than two million people in Bihar.  The Nepalese army has set off a series of controlled blasts over the past three days to drain the artificial lake slowly. Yadav Koirala, chief of the Natural Disaster Relief Division at the home ministry, said the army was trying to increase the river’s flow by draining the artificial lake formed by the landslide.  ""The army set off a small controlled explosion at the mud dam today to drain the lake. It is not a big blast,"" Koirala told Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We are doing it very carefully so the water does not flow suddenly.  Monsoon rains that start in mid-June and continue through September are crucial for many countries in South Asia, but scores of people die every year in landslides and floods.

Original Report 25 June 2014  Late June nearly always means floods in Assam, India. This year is no different, and Assam officials have reported that over 25,000 people have been affected by flooding over the last 2 days. Nearly 10,000 people have been displaced. Five relief camps in Darrang and Udalguri have been set up.  The flooding is a result of the monsoon rains in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The monsoon is said to be late arriving this year, with many forecasters predicting it to bring 5% less rainfall than average. Even so, levels of the Brahmaputra river at Numaligarh and Jia Bhoreli river in Sonitpur are dangerously high. Heavy rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh – situated in the mountainous region to the north – often means problems for Assam. In particular heavy rainfall there feeds the Jia Bhoreli (Kameng) and the Dibang and Lohit rivers, which are tributaries of the Brahmaputra river.

As well as ripping apart homes and destroying possessions, the storm also flattened banana plantations and maize and wheat fields, causing many villagers to lose their livelihoods, he said.  Officials said they were still assessing the scale of the devastation, a process hindered by snapped telecommunication lines and villages cut off by uprooted trees blocking roads.  ""The damage is huge although we cannot provide the exact figure because we are still assessing the extent of damage,"" said Sudhir Kumar, a senior official in Purnia.  Bihar's governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has asked the state government to provide 400,000 rupees ($6,300) in compensation to each of the victims' families.  Weather officials said because the storm developed quickly, there was not enough time to issue an early warning and evacuate villagers to shelters.  India is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, and many of its 1.2 billion people live in areas vulnerable to natural hazards such as floods, cyclones, droughts and earthquakes.  In 2008, major flooding in Bihar triggered by heavy monsoons left more than 500 people dead and disrupted the lives of two million others.

134,258,disaster,"Nearly 1.2 millio­n people are now stayin­g in around 1,600 relief camps opened in school­s and govern­ment office­s  KOLKATA: Floods from days of torrential rain have now claimed at least 180 lives in India with one million people sheltering in relief camps after fleeing surging waters, officials said Tuesday.  Rivers have burst their banks, hitting thousands of villages in parts of West Bengal as well as northeastern Manipur state, where roads and bridges have been cut and communications were patchy.  Most of those 180 died from drowning, while at least four people have been killed in a landslide that buried a remote village in Manipur bordering Myanmar, where heavy monsoon rains have also wreaked havoc.  The death toll jumped from around 120 on Monday, after the discovery of more bodies in West Bengal and the western state of Gujarat where water levels have receded, allowing families to return home.  “The death toll due to flooding in West Bengal rose to 70, with roads and farms in 13,200 villages remaining under water,” disaster management minister Javed Ahmad Khan told AFP.  “Nearly 1.2 million people are now staying in around 1,600 relief camps opened in schools and government offices,” he said.  The release of water from brimming dams has exacerbated the flooding in West Bengal after Cyclone Komen struck the east coast on Friday, Khan said.  “Rivers in 13 districts are flowing over their danger marks. The situation is grim.”  Another five people have died in Orissa and 35 in northern Rajasthan state, officials there said.  “The worst is over. Now we are focusing on relief and rehabilitation of affected people,” Rajasthan’s disaster minister, Gulab Singh Kataria, told AFP.  In Manipur, television footage showed villagers erecting a bamboo bridge over a muddy river after flood waters left them stranded, and a child trying to cross by floating in a rubber tyre.  Rescuers were still searching for villagers feared buried in a landslide that struck their hamlet on Saturday, with four bodies found, Jason Shimray, an official overseeing the rescue operation, said.  Shimray said 10 people feared killed in the landslide have been found alive, although details were sketchy.  In the western state of Gujarat, flooding has eased in recent days, but the death toll has reached 72 after the discovery of more bodies, director of relief operations Bipin Bhatt told AFP.  India, which receives nearly 80 per cent of its annual rainfall from June to September, sees tragedy strike every monsoon season.

139,267,conflict,"Image copyright AP Image caption Both India and Pakistan have accused each other of starting the latest hostilities  Thousands of villagers have fled their homes in Indian-administered Kashmir as Indian and Pakistani troops continue to exchange fire in the region.  At least 10 Indian and Pakistani soldiers and civilians have been killed in the violence over the past week.  Both sides have accused each other of starting the hostilities.  A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.  The latest round of hostilities come days before US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit India. President Barack Obama is also due to visit India as the chief guest at the country's Republic Day celebrations on 26 January.  Some 10,000 civilians living in border villages on the Indian side have fled their homes since fighting began last week, a senior official named Shantmanu told Reuters news agency.  ""We had a narrow escape and there is a war-like situation,"" Sham Kumar, 54, an affected villager said.  ""Pakistani troops are using long-range weapons. It is the first time we have seen such intense shelling.""  He said he had left his village after a shell landed in a school about 3.5km (2 miles) from the border.  India and Pakistan are continuing to exchange fire in the disputed region on Tuesday, reports say.  Image copyright EPA Image caption Hostilities between the neighbours have escalated in the past year  ""The firing is going on and we are giving befitting reply to Pakistani shelling,"" an Indian official said.  Pakistan said on Monday that its soldiers were ""effectively responding to India's [unprovoked] firing"".  A Pakistani military statement said four civilians, including a woman and a teenage boy, had been killed by Indian fire near the city of Sialkot since Sunday.  India said one of its soldiers was killed by Pakistani fire in the Samba area on Monday.  Last week, Indian forces in Kashmir killed four Pakistani troops on the border after an Indian soldier was killed in an attack blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan said it had lodged a protest with the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad.  Hostilities between the neighbours have escalated in the past year.  In October, 16 people - nine Pakistanis and seven Indians - died when the two sides exchanged fire for several days.  Correspondents say 2014 saw an escalation in hostilities between the neighbours, with some of the worst violence in a decade. Both sides have accused each other of initiating the clashes.  Earlier in the summer, India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration and there were hopes that relations between Delhi and Islamabad would improve.  But relations have deteriorated since then, with India cancelling scheduled talks with Pakistan in August and insisting that Delhi would ""not tolerate acts of border violations by Pakistan"" and that ""ceasefire violations must stop"".  Kashmir, claimed by both countries in its entirety, has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years and the South Asian rivals have fought two wars over the region.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-30692286,en
140,268,conflict,"Some 20,000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 2,000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives, or in open fields  By Fayaz Bukhari and Katharine Houreld  P.S. PORA, India/SIALKOT, Pakistan, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It was a balmy night when mortar struck the courtyard of Shahdin Mohammad's home, killing his son and grandson and injuring three other family members who were asleep outside.  He knelt on the ground, cradling his 12-year-old grandson, shouting for help, but by the time a neighbour arrived and drove them to the nearest clinic, it was too late.  ""The firing started at 2 a.m. and we had nowhere to go. We were outside our home and a shell landed right in front of us,"" said Mohammad, a 65-year-old Indian farmer from Jeora Farm village. ""That was the end of the world for me.""  Located about one kilometre (0.62 mile) from India's border with Pakistan, Jeora Farm is one of scores of villages in the disputed Kashmir region being hit by increasing exchange of fire between the two nations.  During an 11 year lull in fighting along this stretch of the border after a 2003 ceasefire, villages grew on both sides, with brick buildings replacing mud huts and schools and wedding halls opening close to check-points but that peace is now shattered.  In August when Mohammad's family was killed, the firing went on for 45 days, affecting rice production and schooling for many children. This month has seen a renewed bout of fighting.  The firing, usually restricted to military posts, has killed 23 civilians this year, the highest death toll in over a decade, and prompted accusations of the deliberate targeting civilians.  This month nine Pakistanis and eight Indians were killed in the latest spat between the South Asian nuclear-armed neighbours.  Amid the fighting some 20,000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 2,000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives, or in open fields, out of the range of fire.  ""There is good reason for concern,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Program Associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Institute for Scholars.  ""Not only are we seeing more civilian casualties than is typically the case, but we're also seeing cases of children wounded and killed by shelling ... It's expanded into a humanitarian tragedy.""  DELIBERATE TARGETS  India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over the mostly-Muslim region of Kashmir with its Himalayan mountains and fertile valleys which they both claim in full but rule in part.  Although the tit-for-tat artillery fire frequently rattles the so-called Line of Control (LoC), separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the clashes have intensified.  Indian military officials say there have been over 110 ceasefire violations by Pakistan so far this year compared to 347 in 2013 and 114 in 2012.  Islamabad says there have been 227 violations by New Delhi this year, against 414 in 2013 and 230 the year before.  But Chief Minister of Indian-administered Kashmir has accused Pakistan of a change in tactic and targeting civilians.  ""Such a large scale loss to the civilians clearly indicates they have changed their strategy from engaging in cross-firing with the forces on this side of border to specifically targeting the civilian areas,"" Omar Abdullah told journalists this week.  Pakistani military officials deny the claim.  Major General Khan Tahir Javed Khan said the Pakistani army only fires mortars back and never at civilians.  He claimed India has fired 19,733 mortars into his 193 km (120 mile) stretch of the disputed border so far this year, compared to 180 in 2012.  ""Our main fire is concentrated onto their posts, not onto their villages,"" Khan insisted.  One mortar hit Irum Shahzadi's home in the Pakistani village of Dhamala early Monday as her three sons leapt out of bed, excited about celebrating the Muslim holiday of Eid.  ""I could not see anything, because of the dark (smoke), so I started groping on the floor. I found my younger son, and lifted him into my lap,"" said Shahzadi, weeping uncontrollably.  ""My entire world has collapsed ... My sons ... one had no face, the other was hit in the chest and in the arms.""  Two of the boys died.  IN THE LINE OF FIRE  In the lush Basmati rice-growing plains of India's R.S. Pora sector, the skirmishes temporarily displace thousands of people who move into schools turned into relief camps and this can disrupt the lives of everyone from children to farmers.  ""First, it was dry weather that affected our crops. Then when it rained, the firing drove us away from the village,"" said Vicky Kumar, a farmer in Abdullain village on the Indian side.  ""We couldn't apply fertilisers and this led to the crop failing. We expect only 50 percent yield this year.""  Children complain of not being able to go to school, saying even when the guns fall silent, they are too scared to go out.  But the biggest challenge facing villagers in this stretch of border comes at night when the mortars fall.  In the Pakistani village of Dhamala, Wazir Bibi said she and her four daughters were always scared but couldn't leave.  ""Every time I hear the blasts, if feels like my heart will burst from my body,"" said Bibi, 65. ""We are women and poor, we cannot sleep in the fields, we have nowhere to go.""  ""HELL'S VILLAGE""  However some villagers living along border said they had benefited from 2003 ceasefire agreement.  In the Indian town of Arnia, people farm their land right up to the international border and have turned their mud houses into two-storey structures with satellite dishes and bathrooms.  Residents proudly point to a wedding hall as a sign of normality, saying previously few marriages occurred here as families refused to marry their daughters to young men living in a place once nicknamed ""Hell's village"".  Shops sell cement and floor tiles to feed a construction boom and a 30 km stretch of road from Jammu town to the border crossing of Suchetgarh is being widened to four lanes.  The plan was to eventually open the area for trade between the two nations, but that seems a distant reality now.  Islamabad and New Delhi blame one another for initiating the border shelling, both saying that they will not back down first.  Pakistan on Thursday said it was capable of responding ""befittingly"" to India, while India said Pakistan would pay an ""unaffordable price"" if it persisted with the shelling.  The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday expressed concern over deaths and displacement of civilians, while human rights groups have warned of the violatation of international humanitarian laws if claims of targeting civilians are true.  ""They should investigate any allegations of violations including the indiscriminate use of weapons such as heavy artillery in densely populated areas, using civilians as human shields, or otherwise placing them at unnecessary risk,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch.

Soldiers in convoys of trucks mounted with rifles are patrolling in Baksa district, where some of the attacks took place.  The violence erupted on Thursday after tribal rebels killed three villagers in Baksa district and eight more in neighbouring Kokrahjar.  The rebels opened fire on the victims as they slept in their homes.  Similar violence, also perpetrated by the tribal rebels, 12 muslims dead on Friday  Police have found nine more bodies, including those of women and children, from Narayanguri village in Baksa district, 200 kilometres from Assam's main city of Guwahati.  Authorities say all the victims were Muslim migrants who have been locked in land disputes with indigenous Bodo tribes in the state, which shares borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan.  Local police said the attacks have forced 5,000 people to flee from their homes.  The violence has also prompted a massive manhunt for the rebels, with police accusing the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland, which has been fighting for a separate homeland, for the attacks.  ""Security has been further tightened with police and paramilitary troopers deployed in strength,"" said police Inspector General S. N. Singh.  Inspector Singh said an indefinite curfew has been imposed the affected districts, with police being given shoot-on-sight orders.  On Sunday, Muslims in Baksa were refusing to bury 18 of those killed, in a protest against authorities whom they blame for failing to protect them.  ""Right now we are sitting in the open with 18 bodies in front of us,"" said Lafiqul Islam, president of the All Bengali Muslim Students Union.  ""We will continue with our protest and not perform the funeral until and unless the chief minister personally visits the spot.""

146,278,disaster,"Image caption A danger zone is being enforced around Mount Sinabung  An active volcano in western Indonesia has let out a series of fresh eruptions, forcing around 19,000 people to flee their homes, officials say.  Mt Sinabung, on the island of Sumatra, erupted nine times late on Monday, shooting lava and gas up to 7,000m (23,000 ft) in the air, officials said.  A 5km (3 mile) danger zone is being enforced around the volcano's crater.  It has been showing signs of life since September, after being dormant for three years.  ""On Monday night, 19,126 people fled their homes, and we expect that number to rise,"" National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.  ""Mount Sinabung remains on the highest alert level,"" he said, adding that police and soldiers were patrolling the danger zone to evacuate people.  When the volcano erupted in 2010, at least two people were killed and 30,000 others were displaced.  Before 2010, Mount Sinabung had not erupted in 400 years. It is one of around 130 active volcanoes in the country.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25548526,en

173,305,disaster,"Heavy rainfall in Borneo and Sumatra over the last 3 days has left parts of Malaysia and Indonesia struggling with yet more flooding. Malaysia is still recovering from the floods of December 2014 in the north of the country, which were some of the worst flooding seen in years.  Sarawak, Malaysia  In Borneo, over 5,000 people have been evacuated in the flood-hit state of Sarawak. This figure has dropped slightly from almost 7,000 earlier today. 38 relief centres have been set up to house those displaced by the floods.  The worst affected area is around the state capital of Kuching, where at one point almost 5,000 were staying in temporary accommodation. Just over 1,000 people have been displaced in Padawan.  One flood-related death has been reported in Mukah, when a teenage girl drowned after a boat capsized in rough waters.  Power Outages  The heavy rain has caused power outages in Limbang, Bau and Lundu after Sarawak Energy Bhd (SEB) said it had shut down several substations in areas affected by torrential rain  Flood Waters Receding but More Rain Forecast  Some reports say that the flood water have started to recede, at least in some places, allowing almost 2,000 to return to their homes. Malaysia’s Drainage and Irrigation Department say there are currently no rivers with water levels at the danger point.  The rainfall over the last 24 hours has been less intense. 64 mm of rain fell in Kuching in 24 hours yesterday, compared to over 250 mm the day before.  However, further heavy rainfall has been forecast for parts of Borneo, including parts of Sarawak, and the Malaysian Meteorological Department has issued Orange level severe weather warnings.  East Kalimantan, Indonesia  Just over the border from Sarawak, the Indonesian provinces of East and West Kalimantan has also been affected by heavy rain and flooding over the last 3 days. Over 160 mm of rain fell in 24 hours in Putussibau yesterday, according to WMO.  Around 1,000 people have been evacuated in East Kalimantan after a river overflowed in the province.

175,308,disaster,"A 6.6-magnitude earthquake hit in waters off Indonesia's easternmost province early Friday, injuring dozens of people, damaging buildings and sending panicked residents fleeing from homes, hotels and even a hospital.  The quake, which struck at 12:53 a.m., was centered 17 miles north of Sorong, a town in Indonesia's West Papua province, the U.S. Geological Survey said on its website. It occurred at a depth of 15 miles.  Hundreds of people fled their homes in panic in Sorong and at least 39 people were hurt, mostly with broken bones, said Petrus Korisano from the local disaster mitigation agency. Nearly 260 houses and buildings were damaged.  Hundreds of people were evacuated to temporary shelters as authorities surveyed the damage, said Korisano.  The panic extended to Manokwari city, 195 miles to the west of the epicenter, where hundreds of patients from at least one hospital had to be evacuated, some in wheelchairs or with IVs attached to their arms, said Burhanudin, an official at the disaster mitigation agency in the city, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. Hotels emptied and residents ran into the streets and higher ground in the Raja Ampat popular tourist destination.  An official from Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, Budi Waluyo, said the underwater quake had no potential to generate tsunami waves along nearby coasts.  The world's largest archipelago, Indonesia is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.  In 2004, a monster temblor off the shores of Aceh in Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries. Most of the deaths were in Aceh province.

176,312,conflict,"This estimate is based on data obtained from various sources, including government agencies, international NGOs, UN agencies and the media. The government collects data on displacement caused by natural hazards and conflict (“social conflicts”) through the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB). However, with regards to conflict-related displacement, government IDP records do not cover all regions of the country or all displacements events. According to official figures, conflict and violence displaced 11,979 people between 2006 and 2015, including 505 in 2014. No displacement was recorded in the first 6 months of 2015 (BNPB, July 2015). However, this figure is likely to significantly under-estimate total displacement as it did not take into account ongoing displacement in Papua and West Papua provinces, as well as a number of displacement events elsewhere in the country. In August 2014 for example, some 500 people were reported displaced in Lembata, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), following inter-communal violence (Tempo, 18 August 2014). This was not included in the records of the BNPB.  At the end of December 2014, BNPB reported that 2.6 million people had been displaced by natural hazard-related disasters in 2014 (Jakarta Post, 31 December 2014). However, available data from the BNPB database shows a much lower total, at 856,720 people (BNPB, January 2015).  Collecting data on protracted displacement is complicated by the fact that many of the conflicts that have led to large-scale displacement took place more than 15 years ago and that information on the whereabouts and needs of IDPs, returnees and those who locally integrated or settled elsewhere is often not available. There is also no monitoring of return or other settlement options or any assessment of the extent to which these have been sustainable. While a number of programs implemented in recent years by local and international agencies in provinces such as Aceh, Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara have made partial data available, in others such as North Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West and Central Kalimantan no data has been available since 2005.  Breakdown of IDP figures by provinces  North Sumatra: (Langkat): 530 households (3,000 people)  Maluku (Ambon & Seram): 1,123 households (5,400 people)  North Sulawesi (Bitung): 120 households (540 people)  East Nusa Tengarra (West Timor): 4,762 households (22,000 people)  West Nusa Tengarra (West Lombok): 37 households (161 people)  East Java (Sidoarjo): 72 households (343 people)  Most IDPs live in protracted displacement  Nearly all the 31,440 IDPs were displaced by inter-communal violence or insurgency-related violence between 1998 and 2004 and have since been unable or unwilling to return and have failed to re-establish their lives through local integration or settlement elsewhere. The majority are located in Aceh, Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara (in particular West Timor) provinces. Others live in North Sulawesi and North Sumatra. The estimate also includes a number of people displaced between 2007 and 2013 by attacks against religious minorities (West Nusa Tenggara and East Java provinces) and who have since failed to return.  IDPs included in the estimate live in both urban and rural areas, mostly in makeshift shelters or resettlement camps.  North Sumatra  In Langkat district, North Sumatra, where many ethnic Javanese who fled the Aceh conflict between 1999 and 2003 attempted to locally integrate and rebuild their lives, some 530 households, or some 3,000 people, living in Sei Lepan camp have been in a long-running land dispute with the local government (Medan Bisnis, 10 February 2015). The displaced are accused of encroaching on the protected Gunung Leuser National Park (BBTNGL, 22 March 2011).  Maluku and North Sulawesi  In Maluku, there are still some 1,123 households, or 5,400 individuals, displaced in the early 2000s who have since been living with host families and temporary settlements in four sub-districts (Buru, South Buru, central Maluku and West Seram) and who remain in need of assistance (IDMC interviews, May 2015).  In addition, some people may be displaced in the province as a result of more recent violence but their number is unknown. Sporadic violence has affected the province in recent years. In February 2012, some 4,000 people fled their village in Pelauw, Central Maluku, following intra-communal violence (AF, 22 February 2012). In 2014, a total of 311 people fled their homes in two separate conflict incidents in West Seram and Central maluku regencies between July and August (BNPB, April 2015).  Many people who fled the conflict in neighbouring North Maluku headed for North Sulawesi where the majority settled permanently (Duncan, 2008, p.16). At least 418 families, or 1,918 people, have been living in 5 settlements since 2000 with lack of access to basic services and no tenure security (Habitat for Humanity, October 2012). During 2013 and 2014, some 270 households were provided with new homes and tenure security, leaving 120 families, or 540 people, still in need of assistance (Habitat for Humanity, interview, 6 May 2015).  East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor)  From the estimated 113,000 people who chose to locally integrate in West Timor after they fled in 1999 from what is now Timor-Leste, some 22,000 continue to live in camps in and around the city of Kupang, requiring livelihood and shelter assistance (Jakarta Post, 17 January 2014).  West Nusa Tenggara and East Java  Since 2011, growing religious intolerance has led to a rise in attacks by Islamist militants against religious minorities, sometimes resulting in their displacement (CWS, 14 February 2014;Setara Institute, 18 January 2014). In East Java, some 343 members of the Shia community evicted from their homes in Sampang regency in December 2011 and again in August 2012 remain displaced (IDMC, May 2015). In West Lombok Regency, West Nusa Tenggara, some 161 members of the Ahmadi Islamic movement displaced in 2006 have since not been able to return to their homes (IDMC interviews, May 2015).  Papua and West Papua  In Papua, the long-running armed conflict between the Indonesian Armed Forces and the non-state armed group the Free Papua Movement – Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM) has mainly displaced people living in remote rural areas. Tens of thousands have been displaced in the past 30 years, many fleeing towards Papua New Guinea settling in camps on both sides of the border (UNHCR, March 2006) where they remain today (JRS, 22 July 2013). In the absence of accurate data on how many are located on the Indonesian side they are not included in the estimate. The number of people still displaced in Papua and West Papua as a result of more recent military operations is unknown. As in previous years, several hundred people were displaced in 2014 and 2015 by military operations in the Central Highland region and in Timika, Mimika regency, but it is unknown whether they were all able to return (AWPA, 9 February 2014,The Guardian, 13 January 2015).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.",http://www.internal-displacement.org/south-and-south-east-asia/indonesia/figures-analysis,en

178,316,disaster,"Heavy rain and flooding since late October have left almost 70 people dead in Iran and Iraq. The UN have said that the flooding in Iraq has exacerbated a cholera outbreak.  Iraq Floods  At least 58 people have died in flash floods over the last week across Iraq, the country’s Health Ministry has said on Friday 06 November 2015.  Many of the victims were killed by electrocution caused by rain-related incidents in several parts of the country. One of the worst hit areas has been the capital Baghdad, where 65,000 residents have been affected by the overflow sewage system due to the extensive flooding, according to UNICEF, adding to the increased risk of cholera.  Floods have also affected areas outside the capital, including Wasit governorate to the south east. The Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS) said that it had evacuated a number of families from their flooded homes in the districts of Badra and Aldboney.  Mr. Haider Al-gaderey, IRCS’s relief team leader said, “A number of houses in the Badra and Aldboney districts have collapsed due to rising in the levels of heavy rains water, and also the flow of water which coming from Iran”.  “IRCS’s relief teams in Wasit, in cooperation with the army aviation, has evacuated families that besieged by floods and take them to safer places, and now they are in good health, as the IRCS’s teams provided them with shelter and food”.  2,200 Cases of Cholera in Iraq  UN agencies and their partners are working to combat a cholera outbreak in Iraq that so far has resulted in more than 2,200 cases of the disease.  “There is unfortunately a high risk that cholera will reach more areas of Iraq, affecting marginalized and displaced children, women and their families in particular, so we have to act fast,” UNICEF Representative in Iraq Peter Hawkins said in a statement made on 06 November 2015.  He added, “Heavy rains in late October inundated several areas of the country considered vulnerable to the spread of cholera”  According to the statement, “since the cholera outbreak was confirmed in mid-September, UNICEF has supported the distribution of bottled water to 37,000 people, and water trucking at a rate of 100,000 litres per day, benefiting 5,000 people. Community water tanks sufficient for 15,500 people have been installed, and family water and hygiene kits distributed to 44,250 families.”  Cholera is caused by contaminated food or water. It can lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not provided quickly.  Floods in Iran Since October 2015  Meanwhile in neighbouring Iran, at least 9 people have been killed and 9 others injured in floods and severe weather that struck in late October 2015. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) say that 24 provinces have been affected in northern and western Iran.  According to IFRC, about 400 Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran National Society teams of 1,800 relief workers and rescuers were mobilised and equipped with 310 vehicles, 50 motor pumps and two helicopters to respond to the emergency situation and offer the much needed aid to the affected communities, reaching more than 17,700 people.  Dr Naser Charkhsaz, the head of the Relief and Rescue Organization at the Red Crescent detailed on the operations of the National Society during and in the aftermath of the flooding: “Red Crescent volunteers pumped water out of 1,300 houses and the National Society’s emergency health teams treated 11 people and transferred 93 others to medical centres. Eighteen people trapped under the rubble were also rescued by the volunteers and 39 were evacuated to safer areas.”  Dr Charkhsaz added that the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran provided shelter to 1,400 people affected by the storms and the floods. The Iranian National Society also got involved in the distribution of relief items to people in the flood-hit areas, and these items included 180 tents, 5,400 blankets, 1,900 mats, 570 kitchen sets, 500 heaters, 2,400 parcels of canned food, 10,000 loaves of bread and 4,300 bottles of water. 8,500 kilograms of relief consignments were also dispatched to flood-hit areas.  The Red Crescent’s emergency response teams are still actively carrying out relief operations in the provinces of Ilam, Lorestan and Kerman.",http://floodlist.com/asia/floods-iran-iraq-70-dead-cholera-outbreak,en
179,318,disaster,"Wildfires broke out across Israel for the second day in a row on Sunday, as unseasonably hot weather and heavy winds sent firefighters scrambling to battle blazes throughout the day.    At Ma’asiyahu Prison in central Israel, 11 people were lightly injured from smoke inhalation, including seven guards, an inmate and three firefighters, after a fire at a woodworking factory in the compound spread out of control.  Relevant to your professional network? Please share on Linkedin  Dozens of fire teams and police swarmed to the scene to battle the blaze, which spread to the prison grounds.By mid-afternoon, Shfela subdistrict police said the fire was under control and denied reports they were preparing to evacuate prisoners from the facility. The smoke inhalation casualties were taken to Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tzrifin for treatment.Also in the Shfela region, firefighters evacuated a resident of Moshav Rambam due to a grass fire, and battled another brush blaze in nearby Karmei Yosef.In the Sharon subdistrict, firefighters fought blazes at Poleg Beach, Even Yehuda junction and in Rosh Ha’ayin.The Rosh Ha’ayin fire came the day after a massive fire at a car-parts warehouse in the area that dozens of crews fought for hours before managing to extinguish it.Other fires broke out in the northern and southern districts of the country, with most of the blazes in open areas being blamed on the harsh weather conditions.Yoram Levy, spokesman for the Fire and Rescue Services, said that since Saturday firefighters have responded to more than 550 calls, at least five times the usual for a 24- hour period.Levy said that while the two most dangerous fires so far – in Ma’asiyahu Prison and in Rosh Ha’ayin last night – were not caused by the weather, the public should avoid building bonfires altogether if possible.The plea was made despite it coinciding with Lag Ba’omer, which began on Saturday evening and is celebrated by lighting bonfires, typically by young people in parks. Levy called on those who do hold bonfires to make them as small as possible, not to leave them unattended and to make sure to extinguish them fully before leaving their sites.In Jerusalem, some 200 residents of Kfar Uriya were evacuated at 2 a.m. on Sunday after a forest fire spread from Lag Ba’omer celebrations near Beit Shemesh, according to Jerusalem Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Asaf Abras.“We received assistance from nearly 20 units from central and southern Israel to help us put it out, but it was difficult [to extinguish] due to the dry conditions,” said Abras. “We were finally able to allow residents to return safely to their homes Sunday morning at around 6 a.m.”Abras said wildfires also broke out in the Jerusalem Forest, Ramot, Har Nof and Moshav Beit Zayit, resulting in the destruction of roughly 2,000 dunams of vegetation.Additionally, a brush fire in East Talpiot resulted in nine vehicles in the UN building’s parking catching fire.“Over the last 24 hours we’ve been dealing with a lot of small and big fires because of people not being responsible while observing Lag Ba’omer near brush and forest,” Abras said.He added that although all the blazes have since been extinguished, firefighters have remained on call to ensure continued public safety during pos-tholiday celebrations.",http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Wildfires-break-out-across-Israel-for-2nd-day-311357,en
181,322,disaster,"At least 4 people have died in Italy after two days of heavy rain caused floods and landslides in several regions across the country.  Meanwhile heavy rain in the Balkans has raised fears of a repeat of the devastating floods of May 2014.  As of yesterday, flooding had affected only a few areas in Croatia and Bosnia. However, river levels are expected to rise significantly after several days of heavy rain. Some areas received over 120 mm in a 24 hour period.  4 Killed in Italy  Storms and heavy rain have caused flooding and landslides in central and southern regions.  Italy’s civil protection agency say that 4 people have died in landslides and floods over the last 2 days. Two of the people died in the province of Aquila in the Abruzzo region, where around 50 people had to be evacuated after a river overflowed. Other fatalities have been reported in the province of Frosinone in Lazio region, and one in the province of Benevento, Campania region.  Flooding has also affected the provinces of Palermo, Messina and Trapani in Sicily.  ECHO said that on 14 October around 75 mm of rain fell in 24 hours in Pisa, Tuscany region and 135 mm in Venice.  Croatia  Croatian authorities have issued alerts for levels the Kupa and Vojlovica rivers. ECHO reported yesterday that “maximum water levels on Sava river are expected on 15th to 16th October in the Karlovac area and upriver of Crnac area. During the weekend the maximum water levels are expected in Sisak area (Kupa – Sava Basin). Next week the water wave will flow downriver from Sisak towards Jasenovac, Slavonski Brod and Županja”.  Some flooding has been reported in Croatia, according to local media. Parts of the city of Karlovac in central Croatia, were under water yesterday, 15 October, 2015, after the Kupa and Korana rivers overflowed.  Below is a map of the flooded area around Karlovac from Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) of the European Union. According to EMS, nearly 10,000 hectares have been flooded in the area, with almost 20 km of roads left under water and over 5,000 people affected..  For complete details and map, see the Copernicus map here.  Flooding has also been reported in the southern county of Sibenik-Knin county where several buildings and roads have been damaged. Coastal areas suffered some of the worst of the heavy rain.  Bosnia  Bosnia has seen some of the heaviest rainfall over the last 2 days. ECHO reported that 120 mm of rain fell in Mostar in 24 hours between 14 and 15 October.  Between 14 and 15 October, Livno saw 83.5 mm and Sanski Most 63.2 mm in 24 hours.

183,328,disaster,"At least one person was dead and six were missing Monday as a strong typhoon whipped through the Tokyo metropolitan area after making landfall further south, bringing torrential rain and strong winds to the Kanto region.  Typhoon Phanfone, the 18th of the season, headed out to sea and was expected to weaken to an extratropical depression off Japan’s northern Pacific coast, the Meteorological Agency said.  A total of 39 people in 17 prefectures were injured, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.  Police continued their search for two men who went missing due to mudslides in Yokohama and a junior high school boy who was swamped by waves in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture.  About 2.7 million people in eight prefectures were advised to evacuate, while more than 50,000 were given actual orders to leave. Among them were residents on Izu-Oshima Island, where heavy rains caused deadly mudslides in October last year.  The evacuation orders were lifted as of Monday night.  At 6 p.m., the typhoon was quickly moving east-northeast in the Pacific east of Japan, with an atmospheric pressure of 980 hectopascals at its center, according to the Meteorological Agency.  The typhoon triggered the cancelation of more than 600 flights and the suspension of about 100 runs on the Tokaido Shinkansen Line, affecting more than 100,000 people.  Commuter trains saw delays and suspensions as well, disrupting the morning rush hour.  The agency issued warnings for strong winds, mudslides and river flooding as the typhoon broke rainfall records in some areas.  The city of Shizuoka got 87 mm per hour in Aoi Ward, while Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, got 72 mm — both local records.  In Shizuoka Prefecture, 267,000 households comprising 667,000 people had been urged to evacuate to safer ground as of 9:30 a.m., the prefectural government said.  In Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, more than 4,600 people were urged by authorities to flee to avoid river flooding.  The Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, plagued by radiation-tainted water, was bracing to receive 50 mm of rain per hour. Tokyo Electric Power Co. halted work both on land and at sea, bundling cables and hoses and tying down heavy machinery.  “We are also patrolling and checking where water may flow in,” a Tepco spokesman said.  Meanwhile, the search for the bodies of at least 12 hikersbelieved to be lying on the still-smouldering Mount Ontake was suspended. Rescue workers have already been retrieved 51 bodies.  The volcano was packed with climbers during the surprise eruption on Sept. 27 — Japan’s deadliest in almost 90 years. Nearly 1,000 Self-Defense Forces personnel, firefighters and police were participating in a search made all the more treacherous by toxic gases still rising from the peak, as well as a knee-deep layer of sticky ash.  “We want to resume operations as soon as possible when weather permits,” said an official with the Nagano Prefecture crisis management office. Mount Ontake straddles Nagano and Gifu prefectures.  People living below the mountain were warned that the downpour could dislodge the layers of ash, causing mudslides. On Sunday, three U.S. airmen on Okinawa Island were washed away by the typhoon. One was found dead and the other two remain missing, according to the U.S. Air Force and the Japan Coast Guard.  The airmen were photographing the rough weather on the island’s northern coast when they were overcome by the waves, according to Tsuguyoshi Miyagi of the Coast Guard’s Okinawa branch.  The U.S. Air Force said the search had been interrupted by rough seas. Their names were being withheld pending notification of relatives.  “Three officials were taking pictures with high waves whipped up by the typhoon in the background,” a spokesman from the municipal police said early Monday.  A 21-year-old surfer also went missing in the waters off Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, a Coast Guard spokesman said.  Okinawa is home to about half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan.  Several people in Kyushu were injured by the typhoon as the storm grounded more than 100 flights Sunday and knocked out power to more than 9,500 homes.  In Suzuka, Mie Prefecture, a French driver was severely injured in an accident in the Japanese Grand Prix, which had to be shortened as the heavy rain made conditions too dangerous. Formula One driver Jules Bianchi of the Marussia team went off the track at a turn and hit a recovery vehicle that was removing a car that had crashed earlier.  An unconscious Bianchi was taken to a nearby hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a severe head injury. Race officials said he was in critical condition.  Elsewhere in the Pacific, the 19th typhoon of the season whipped the Mariana Islands, including Guam, with high winds and heavy rain.  Typhoon Vongfong was expected to reach an area of the sea southeast of Okinawa around early Saturday.  In the Marianas, the eye of the typhoon skirted the small island of Rota. Power outages and minor flooding were reported in some areas Monday morning as damage reports started to arrive.  Rota has about 2,500 residents and many of its buildings made of concrete.  The weather service canceled a flash-flood watch for the islands around 8:30 a.m. Monday, as the storm shifted farther west. Light to moderate rain was expected to continue for several hours, with occasional downpours, but major flooding was not expected, the agency said.",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/06/national/strong-typhoon-bearing-tokyo-area/#.VUoqco6qpBd,en
184,329,disaster,"Japan is bracing for Typhoon ""Halong"" which is expected to make landfall in central Shikoku late Saturday or early Sunday, August 10, 2014. Halong already lashed large areas of southwestern Japan bringing heavy rain and strong winds grounding about 460 fights. About 140 000 residents of southern Japan have been advised to evacuate.  JMA warned of major landslides and floods mainly in western Japan. Population affected by Category 1 (120 km/h) wind speeds or higher is 2.7 million.  Special warning has been issued for Shikoku, which expects about 70 centimetres (28 inches) of rainfall, Kyushu, and the Kinki region of Japan's main island Honshu.  At 09:00 UTC today, Halong was located approximately 179 nautical miles (205 miles/331 km) southeast of Sasebo, Japan, and has tracked north-northeastward at 12 knots (13.8 mph/22.2 km/h) over the past six hours. Maximum significant wave height at 06:00 UTC today was 26 feet (7.9 meters).  At the same time Halong's maximum sustained winds were 70 knots (80.5 mph/129 km/h - Category 2 typhoon on Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale), wind gusts were 85 knots (97.8 mph/157.4 km/h).  Once it hits land in central Shikoku the typhoon is expected to rapidly weaken. It will pass most of Japan's territory over the weekend and reach its northwestern regions by Monday.

It soon became the third Super-Typhoon of 2014 in the Western Pacific basin.  A man drowned in a raging river while more than half a million people were advised to evacuate as heavy rain from Typhoon Nakri lashed the country last weekend.  Typhoon ""Halong"" comes a month after Typhoon ""Neoguri"" killed several people and left a trail of destruction in southern Japan.  Update:  Halong was downgraded to a tropical storm as it approached southwest coast and made two landfalls over Shikoku Island and Hyogo prefecture in western Japan. One person died and more than 50 were injured.  JMA issued the highest alert for heavy rain in Mie prefecture in central Japan, prompting two towns to order about 570 000 residents to move away from swollen rivers. Another 600 000 people were advised to evacuate across the country.

185,330,disaster,"Typhoon Neoguri weakened to a tropical storm as it moved toward Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu after prompting the evacuation of almost 90,000 people amid threats of floods and landslides.  Neoguri was about 230 kilometers (143 miles) southwest of Sasebo, on Kyushu, with top winds reaching 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said in an advisory at 11 a.m. New York time. It would be classified as a tropical storm on the U.S. Saffir-Simpson scale.  “The weakening trend is expected to continue as sea surface temperatures decrease,” the center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, said in a forecast analysis.  Neogrui, which was moving east-northeast as of 11:45 p.m. local time, left 20 injured yesterday in Okinawa, where it grounded flights and prompted evacuations. As it nears Kyusho, it will encounter more wind shear that will tear at its structure, and the island’s mountains will further weaken it.  Parts of Kyushu will probably be hit with violent winds, swollen rivers and waves up to 10 meters high, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported on its website. While rain will generally amount to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) to 3 inches, some areas may get as much as 5 inches, leading to “localized flooding in higher terrain,” said Commodity Weather Group LLC.  “Winds will be down to 35 knots when it passes Tokyo about 24 hours later,” David Streit, a forecaster at Commodity Weather in Bethesda, Maryland, said in an e-mail received at 6:23 p.m. Tokyo time.  Evacuations Urged  Officials in the Kyushu city of Amakusa urged 87,327 residents today to take shelter in gyms and other centers as the storm threatened homes, public broadcaster NHK reported on its website.  Companies with Kyushu factories, including Nissan Motor Co. and Toshiba Corp., were monitoring the storm’s approach.  “We instructed factories and offices in Japan to take measures for safety against the approaching typhoon,” said Yu Takase, a spokeswoman for Toshiba, which has a chip factory in Kyushu’s Oita prefecture. “Right now, our factories are operating as usual.”  Nissan and Toyota Motor Corp. planned to decide on any countermeasures by this evening, the companies said.  Toyota and Nissan built 1.32 million vehicles at their four plants in Kyushu last year, Satomi Hamada, a production analyst for IHS Automotive, wrote in an e-mail.  Nissan’s two plants on the island accounted for 65 percent of the company’s domestic production last year, while Toyota’s portion was 18 percent.  Eastward Turn  The storm was expected to pivot east as Neoguri interacts with a low-pressure system over Manchuria, said Jim Andrews, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. The low has created a vigorous westerly jet stream that will push the storm into Kyushu.’  Andrews said the remnants of Neoguri may hug Japan’s east coast. He said Tokyo itself will probably be spared the worst because it is sheltered by mountains to the south.  Japan Airlines Co. and its affiliates grounded 11 flights to and from southern Japan earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The All Nippon Airways Co. group canceled 29 flights, affecting 2,000 passengers.  Refinery Halted  Nansei Sekiyu KK, a unit of Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA, halted refining and shipping operations at its 100,000 barrel-a-day Nishihara plant in Okinawa, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Marine operations at JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.’s 270,000-barrel-a-day Negishi refinery near Tokyo remained suspended because of high waves caused by the storm’s approach, according to a company official who asked not to be identified because of internal policy.  One serious injury in Okinawa was attributed to the storm, while 19 people suffered slight injuries, according to a statement from Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency, which gave no other details.  The Mainichi newspaper reported that a man died yesterday after the fishing boat he was aboard capsized off the island of Shikoku farther northeast from the storm’s center, where the weather agency has a high-wave advisory in effect.  Japan has averaged more than 11 typhoons per year over a 30-year period ending in 2010, most of them occurring between July and October, according to the weather agency’s website.",http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-08/typhoon-neoguri-weakens-0n-track-toward-kyushu-island.html,en
186,337,disaster,"Officials in Japan confirmed an eighth fatality Wednesday in the wake of disastrous flooding unleashed by torrential rainfall that hit the eastern and northern parts of the country in the wake of Tropical Storm Etau earlier this month.  Fourteen of the 15 people reported missing in the Japanese city hardest-hit by last week's floods and landslides were reported safe and accounted for on Tuesday, and the 15th name on the list proved to be there in error, marking the end of the search and rescue effort in a region still reeling from the deaths and a heavy toll of material losses in the wake of Tropical Storm Etau.  The 15 people had been reported missing in Joso city, Ibaraki Prefecture, where a levee was breached by the swollen Kinugawa River as unprecedented rainfall struck parts of eastern and northern Japan last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Public broadcaster NHK said one of the names on the list was the result of a ""telephone lie,"" but also cited experts who put forth other possible explanations for the mixup, which lasted only a few hours after the other 14 people had been reported alive and safe.  As the rescue effort ended, however, more than 2,700 people were still in evacuation shelters, their homes in varying states of disrepair as more rain moved in.  (MORE: Mount Aso Volcano Erupts in Western Japan)  Much of the devastation occurred in three prefectures – Tochigi and Ibaraki, neighboring prefectures in the northern part of the Greater Tokyo region; and Miyagi, a prefecture on the Pacific coast of northern Japan devastated by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.  The tally of homes flooded but not structurally damaged in last week's deluge exceeded that of the 2011 calamity, topping 18,000 in a government report Tuesday afternoon. However, the number of homes destroyed or structurally damaged in the disaster – 118 – pales in comparison to the catastrophe four and a half years ago, which destroyed 124,690 homes and damaged another 1,039,961 in what remains the world's costliest natural disaster of all time.  Here are the latest statistics from the Japanese government's Fire and Disaster Management Agency and other national and local governments as of Friday, Sept. 18:  The death toll is eight: three in Tochigi Prefecture, three in Ibaraki Prefecture, and two in Miyagi Prefecture.  There are 46 confirmed injuries, with Ibaraki Prefecture accounting for 24 of them.  A total of 18,882 dwellings have been confirmed flooded. Ibaraki leads this list as well, with 12,088 flooded homes.  In addition to the flooded homes, 16 dwellings have been destroyed and another 102 have structural damage.  Damage also occurred to 61 non-residential structures.  Damage to the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries has reached 11.7 billion yen (about 98 million U.S. dollars).  At least 455 landslides were reported – 358 of them in Tochigi Prefecture alone, and 312 of those in the city of Nikkō, according to the prefectural government.  Up to 26 inches of rain fell in eastern Japan Sunday through Friday due to Tropical Storm Etau and its remnant low.  Local officials in Ibaraki Prefecture said 1,344 people had been rescued via helicopter by the country's Self-Defence Force and rescuers from 10 of the country's 47 prefectures.  Key developments in the storm:  On Wednesday, Sept. 16, officials confimed the death of a 40-year-old man who had been out on his bicycle when the floods hit Ibaraki Prefecture on Sept. 10.  A 60-year-old man was found dead Saturday after the vehicle he was in was swept into a flooded river Friday morning in the city of Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture. A 48-year-old woman also died in that incident.  Japanese media said a pair of eight-year-old boys were among those found alive and removed from the list of missing Saturday.  Two men, ages 71 and 51, were found dead in rice fields flooded by the levee breach in Joso, according to public broadcaster NHK. The men were not previously among the list of missing.  The Japanese government's Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirmed that a man found dead in a flooded vehicle in Tochigi Prefecture Sunday morning died of storm-related causes.  A 63-year-old woman was confirmed dead after a landslide struck Kanuma city, Tochigi Prefecture, early Thursday. The woman was missing for hours before being found dead Thursday evening.  A man in his 20s was confirmed dead Friday after falling into a flooded drainage pipe Thursday in Nikkō city, Tochigi Prefecture.  Rare emergency weather warnings were issued for Tochigi, Ibaraki and Miyagi prefectures on Thursday and Friday, but have all since been lowered.  A magnitude-5.2 earthquake struck Tokyo Bay at 5:49 a.m. local time Saturday, rattling the entire Tokyo region and prompting fears of quake-triggered landslides in rain-soaked hilly terrain.  The earthquake injured seven people in Tokyo and its suburbs, according to the FDMA.  Another earthquake, rated magnitude 4.6 and centered off the east coast of Ibaraki Prefecture, rattled the Joso flood zone nearly six hours later but with weaker ground shaking.  The Shibui River broke through a levee in Ōsaki city, Miyagi Prefecture, on Friday morning. At least 1,000 people were stranded in floodwaters, according to the newspaper Asahi Shimbun.  The Japan Meteorological Agency issued the maximum ""Level 5"" flood warning Friday for the Yoshida River in Miyagi Prefecture and for the Mogamiogumi River in Yamagata Prefecture.  More than 800 people in the mountainous town of Minamiaizu, Fukushima Prefecture, were cut off from the outside world due to flooding and landslides on the lone highway through town Friday.  The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a rare emergency heavy rainfall warning for Miyagi Prefecture and its 2.3 million residents early Friday as torrential rains continued to drench the prefecture, which includes the city of Sendai, raising concerns of landslides and river flooding. The JMA observation site near Sendai's central business district reported 269 millimeters (10.59 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period between 7:40 a.m. Thursday and 7:40 a.m. Friday local time. (Japan is 13 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Daylight Time.) JMA lowered the warning for Miyagi Friday evening.  New pictures emerge of the worsening flood situation in eastern Japan @SkyNewsAust pic.twitter.com/tU8tt8LClY (@Amy_Greenbank) — SKY NEWS WEATHER (@SkyWeatherAUS) September 10, 2015  ""We can say this is an abnormal situation and there is imminent serious danger,"" said Takuya Deshimaru, chief forecaster at the Japan Meteorological Agency, according to the BBC.  On Thursday, JMA issued similar emergency weather warnings for 5 million people in Tochigi Prefecture and Ibaraki Prefecture, north and northeast of Tokyo, on Thursday morning. The warnings were issued as a band of heavy rainfall associated with the post-tropical remnant of Tropical Storm Etau stalled over eastern Japan, dumping up to 21 inches of rain in 24 hours near the head of the Kunigawa River, which drains south through the northern suburbs of Tokyo.  The emergency warnings in Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures were lowered Friday morning.  Levee Break Unleashes Dangerous Flash Flood  Early Thursday afternoon, the Kinugawa River breached a levee in the city of Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture. Prefectural government officials there said 22 people were missing due to the flooding and hundreds of others were still awaiting rescue Friday morning, according to public broadcaster NHK. All of the missing have since been accounted for, but it took several days to rescue all of the stranded residents.  JMA had already issued its highest level of flood warning for the Kinugawa River Thursday morning before the breach occurred.  Japan's Self-Defense Force sent helicopters to the scene, plucking a number of people from rooftops and the top stories of homes near the stricken levee. Japanese television stations broadcast some of the dramatic scenes live as they happened during the early afternoon hours Thursday.  In one disturbing scene, two people were seen struggling to cling to the roof of what appeared to be a garage or shed as the structure began to crumble beneath them and collapse into the raging floodwaters. The television broadcast, streamed live on the website houdoukyoku.jp, quickly cut away from the images to show its in-studio anchors. The fate of the couple is not immediately clear.  The scenes played out again Friday morning, as SDF helicopters plucked more victims standing on rooftops underneath sunnier skies.  At least 7,000 homes damaged or destroyed in Ibaraki. pic.twitter.com/UKk7uDSIrx — Robert Speta (@robertspeta) September 10, 2015  Efforts continued by helicopter and by ground Saturday, even as an earthquake centered in Tokyo Bay rattled the flood zone with moderate ground shaking. More rescues took place Sunday, when two men were found dead in rice paddies – the first confirmed fatalities in the Joso levee breach incident.  By Monday, images broadcast on national television showed much of the built-up portion of Joso had dried out, but crews were still working to pump standing water from flooded rice fields back into the Kinugawa and its tributaries. Efforts to repair the compromised section of levee were also well underway.  Tochigi Prefecture: Landslides Turn Deadly  According to the Tochigi Prefecture government, a landslide early Thursday in the city of Kanuma left one person dead and another person injured. NHK says the body of the missing person, a 63-year-old woman, was found Thursday evening. The woman was later confirmed dead.  Kanuma reported 444 millimeters (17.48 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period ending at 6 a.m. local time Thursday; in records that began in 1976, this was more than double the city's previous 24-hour record of 212 mm (8.35 inches) set July 11, 2002.  The incident was one of 41 landslides reported by the prefectural government. One home each was damaged in two of the landslides, and 11 people were trapped but later rescued in another of the incidents. The government said five people were stranded in Nikkō due to flooding on a local river Wednesday night; firefighters rescued them around daybreak Thursday.  The rain was extraordinarily heavy in and around the city of Nikkō, a popular tourist destination in Tochigi Prefecture. JMA's observation side in that city's Imaichi district recorded 668.0 millimeters (26.30 inches) of rain Sunday through Thursday. Of that amount, 541 mm (21.30 inches) fell within a 24-hour period Wednesday and early Thursday. The nearby Ikari observation site in Nikkō city logged 551 mm (21.69 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period ending at 6:30 a.m. Thursday; that was the highest 24-hour rainfall total anywhere in Japan during the storm.  Those sites' 24-hour rainfall totals were the highest ever recorded since rainfall measurements began there in the late 1970s – and the 24-hour totals alone at both sites were greater than the previous 72-hour rainfall records for each location. The same is true of several other nearby sites – a sign of just how extreme the rainfall has been.  Evacuation Orders Lifted for Most Areas  Voluntary evacuations became mandatory in some locales as the rain continued and rivers rose. In all, about 192,000 people were ordered to evacuate at some point during the tropical storm and ensuing floods, according to the FDMA. At least 15,000 people remained under orders to stay out of flooded areas in and near the city of Joso as of Monday morning.  Most of the voluntary evacuation advisories, which covered 3.1 million people during various stages of the storm, had been lifted by Saturday evening. Fewer than 3,000 people were still under voluntary evacuations Monday morning, mostly in Joso.  Storm Impacts Wide Swath of Japan  Tropical Storm Etau affected many other areas of Japan prior to and during its landfall. Here's a wrap of its impacts Tuesday and Wednesday:  Tochigi Prefecture: Officials were investigating whether rainfall in advance of Etau's landfall contributed to a slope failure at a mine in Ashikaga on Tuesday afternoon. According to Tokyo television station TBS, a 20-year-old worker was buried alive and later died in the hospital.

Mie Prefecture: Heavy rainfall caused at least one landslide in the city of Toba, which was also buffeted by strong winds as the center of Tropical Storm Etau passed just east of the prefecture Wednesday.  History of Tropical Storm Etau  Etau formed early Monday (Japan time) about 1,000 miles due south of Tokyo. It has been moving in a generally northward direction ever since. At 10:22 a.m. Japan time Wednesday (9:22 p.m. U.S. EDT Tuesday), the Japan Meteorological Agency announced that the center of Tropical Storm Etau had made landfall on the Chita Peninsula of Aichi Prefecture shortly after 10 a.m. local time. The landfall point was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Nagoya, the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan area.  Later Wednesday, the center emerged into the Sea of Japan. JMA said Etau became a post-tropical low-pressure center at 9 p.m. Japan time Wednesday.  As of late Wednesday evening, the top reported sustained wind on land was 22.8 meters per second (51.0 mph) at 9:47 p.m. local time at Cape Erimo on Japan's northernmost major island, Hokkaido. The top gust was 30.9 m/s (69.1 mph) at 5:03 a.m. local time Wednesday on the small island of Kozushima, about 100 miles south of Tokyo.  Tropical Storm Etau was known as ""Typhoon No. 18"" in Japan, where tropical cyclones are typically referred to by number rather than name, and ""typhoon"" is used for all systems of tropical-storm or higher strength.  The name ""Etau"" was also given to a tropical storm that drenched Japan in 2009, killing 28 people and flooding thousands of homes.

According to the committee of emergency situations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan, high temperatures over the last few days have melted snow and caused a glacial lake to overflow, which in turn forced the Kargalinka River to overflow and sent mud and flood water racing downstream towards Almaty. Local media report that a dam on the Kargalinka River partially stopped the mudslide.  Districts on the outskirts of Almaty city, including Algabas and Alatau, have been worst affected. Authorities say that 1,036 people were evacuated from affected areas and accommodated in local schools. Six people were hospitalized and 78 were given medical assistance, according to the Сommittee for Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  A total of 127 houses suffered damage. Bridges, roads and power lines have also been damage.

The government has already spend over Sh15.4 Billion in resettlement of 173,809 households displaced from the 2007-08 post-election violence.  According to recommendations from National Consultative Coordination Committee on Internally Displaced Persons (NCCC) there are 98,327 households awaiting resettlement from government.  The victims comprise of 75,293 Households integrated IDPs, 2,127 Households- Kipkurere Forest Evictees, 357 Households-Sambalat landslide victims, 1, 000 Households- Mandera IDPs, 13,618 Households unprofiled IDPs and 5,932 Households un-profiled forest evictees.  The committee in its recommendations after a meeting chaired by Deputy President William Ruto in August 18 this year want the resettlement of 75,293 integrated IDPs to be finalized and chapter closed.  The committee wants the National administration to conduct fresh profiling of 2,127 households evicted from Kipkurere forest to weed out individuals how have since been resettled by government before finalizing the resettlement.  The committee also asked the government to re-profile Sambalat landslide IDPs alongside 13,618 IDPS in unprofiled camps and 5,932 forest evictees before being resettled.  The committee notes that the entire resettlement of IDPs will cost the government Sh4.48 Billion out of which the Committee has Sh2,323,820,147 available this financial year.  Treasury in the 2015-16 budget allocated Sh2,205,000,000 in a bid to finalise the exercise which has dragged for several years.  The Committee was forced to reduce an initial budget of Sh891million which was meant for construction of IDP houses in Government procured farms, profiling of IDPS and forest evictees among other activities in cost cutting measures which saved the government Sh425Million.  The resettlement excise will see each household receive Sh200,000 cash benefit from government to enable them purchase land with the government considering on using NYS to build houses for IDPs to reduce costs.  The Committee has asked the government to immediately release funds to 470 households who were displaced in Mandera and were recently paid Sh150,000 each.  According to the committee each household should be paid an additional Sh50,000 while the County government of Mandera is set to receive sh50 million to facilitate the resettlement of the IDPs.  The committee also wants the government to resettle all integrated IDPs together with forest evictees to allow the government issue a new policy declaration of future IDPs.  ""Once the current IDPs are assisted there is need to issue a policy declaration to bring the matter to closure to enable NCCC embark on new chapter on internal displacement,"" the Committee recommends.  The Committee comprises representatives from the Ministry of Devolution and Planning, Interior and National Coordination, National Treasury, Land, Housing and Urban Development, Attorney General's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The dispatch also said more than 300 acres of farmland have been flooded.  The heavy rains occurred as the remnants of Typhoon Goni passed by the Korean Peninsula overnight Tuesday. North Korea often suffers heavy damages from summer rains due to poor drainage, deforestation and dilapidated infrastructure.  Southwestern Japan took Typhoon Goni's best shot on Tuesday, as the storm damaged buildings, flooded streets and triggered landslides.  Goni made landfall in Japan about 6 a.m. local time Tuesday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The BBC said authorities ordered evacuations for more than 600,000 residents due to the threats from mudslides and flooding.

During the first few days of the flooding, around 1,500 people were evacuated, and about 300 of the displaced continued to stay at camps for several days as the water receded.  “The figures are expected to increase in the coming days, as Red Cross assessment teams access remote areas of Rakhine affected by the flooding,” explains U Maung Maung Khin, head of disaster management for the Myanmar Red Cross Society.  Currently the Myanmar Red Cross is working alongside local authorities to assist affected communities.

Further relief stocks will be distributed in the coming days in the township of Thandwe.  “The floods have triggered landslides in some areas.

217,394,disaster,"MAKOLONGA/LINYANTI – Following heavy rainfall in the Zambezi Region the two constituencies of Sibbinda and Linyanti have experienced flooding for the first time in decades which has forced hundreds of people from their homes.  Villages in areas such as Makolonga, Mazoba, Sibbinda and Linyanti have been submerged by rainwaters for more than a week, with the situation said to be exacerbated by underground water that is spewing out from below the surface due to a fairly shallow water table.  At Mbozi village in the Makolonga area more than 15 households have been made homeless with a dozen having relocated to dry areas, while some have chosen to stay put to guard their possessions. Just a few kilometres further west 18 villages are reportedly affected with some homesteads having already succumbed to floodwaters and collapsed.  Some roads leading to villages have been completely cut off by the rainwater.  At Linyanti the interior of homes have been heavily flooded. Floors and furniture have been spoiled, plus food such as drought relief maize received by the villagers.  The Zambezi Regional Council Chairperson Raphael Mbala, who was accompanied by the Director of Planning Robert Mapenzi to assess the calamity first hand, described the situation as worrisome but confirmed the regional council is providing help to affected residents.  “We learnt about the problem last week that the two constituencies of Linyanti and Sibbinda are heavily affected following heavy rains. The regional council has already sent a team that is on the ground to make sure that tents are put up. We will also team up with the Red Cross and other stakeholders to make sure that there is safe drinking water and mosquito nets,” assured Mbala.  Sikosinyana Secondary School in the Sibbinda Constituency has been seriously affected and some teachers have also been forced to relocate. The flooding has left many residents in awe as many have only heard about previous flooding in the eastern parts of the Zambezi Region but not experienced it first hand. According to information obtained from locals the last time such heavy flooding occurred in Sibbinda was in 1978 and then again in 2006.  An induna in Linyanti village where 11 households are affected, Simon Chombo Mutimani, described the situation as “startling” saying he had never experienced such disaster since resettling in the area.  “It is the first time I experience this in our village. We are very much surprised,” said Mutimani.  Andrew Muyunda in the nearby village who was not home at the time of the flooding was equally alarmed, with some of his possessions having been completely destroyed by the rainwater.  “I was not at the village when the disaster occurred. When I arrived I found that my furniture had been washed away,” narrated Muyunda.  With the heavy rains continuing many more villages are feared to will face similar flooding, a situation that is likely to put a heavy burden on the regional council which is already busy with flood relief efforts in the regularly flood-prone areas of eastern Zambezi.

218,395,disaster,"Complaints to ACC drop  BUSY YEAR: The director general of the ACC, Paulus Noa. Photo File  The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) investigated 172 of the 401 allegations of corruption referred to it during the financial year 2015/16.    It forwarded 29 cases to the prosecutor-general, of which 13 were prosecuted.    The number of complaints received by the ACC had decreased by 6% from the previous financial year.    The commission referred all non-corruption cases to other authorities and 184 cases were closed without investigation.    The ACC says cases are closed because there are no reasonable grounds for investigating, or the matter is non-jurisdictional, or the matter is the subject of an investigation by another body, or the complaint is frivolous or vexatious.    The extent of the fraud in the cases referred to the PG's office amounted to more than N$27 million. Other notable cases under investigation by the ACC during 2015/16 involved amounts totalling N$132 million.    One of these cases involved eight public servants from the Ministry of Health and Social Services who had conspired to channel close to N$5 million into a bank account to which they had access.    At the Henties Bay municipality three private persons submitted fraudulent claims of N$788 995 that were paid out by corrupt officials.    The ACC reported that a prisoner had orchestrated a criminal scam involving N$20 000 from police cells where he was detained.    Two public servants at the Oshikoto regional council attempted to embezzle N$20 million from a toilet-construction project.    An employee of the Hardap regional council working in the Schlip constituency was accused of having misappropriated N$62 446 collected for water and electricity.    The ACC also investigated and charged Namibians and a group of Angolans who had connived to submit fraudulent value-added tax refund claims to the value of N$114 million. The accused were charged under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA). The High Court has issued forfeiture orders totalling more than N$20 million against the accused.    There was also alleged corruption involving N$11 million at the former Polytechnic of Namibia, where forged documentation was used to allow students with outstanding debts to register.    A bribe of N$1 million was reportedly solicited at Unam for the awarding of a security contract.    A former employee at the Namibia Development Corporation was accused of fraud amounting to close to N$5 million.    The ACC forwarded documentation to the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the PG's office in order to restrain close to N$3 million that had been transferred into the bank account of an employee of August 26 Industries because the origin of the funds was suspicious.

219,397,disaster,"The massive landslide that struck in the Nepal district of Sindhupalchowk on 01 August 2014 has blocked the Sunkoshi (Sun Kosi) river, creating a lake that some reports claim measures at least three kilometres by 300 metres.  The landslide buried dozens of homes and left over 150 people missing. Rescue teams including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are working in the area but initial reports say the chances of finding the victims alive are fading. Several villages situated along the river have been evacuated. Around 120 relief camps have been set up to accommodate the displaced.  The Sunkoshi hydropower project has been shut down as a result of the flooding. Two more power stations further downstream are also threatened. The whole area has been declared a “Flood Crisis Zone” by the Nepal government.  Nepalese military engineers, assisted by engineers from India, have been working in the area to try to unblock the river to find a way to allow safe controlled runoff of the water. So far 2 low intensity blasts have partially removed some of the landslide debris. The current plan appears to take a step-by-step approach so that the accumulated water is discharged slowly.  Threat of Floods in Bihar, India  In the Indian state of Bihar that borders Nepal, thousands are at risk of flooding from the blocked Sunkoshi river in Nepal. The Bihar Disaster Management Department (DMD) say that levels of the Kosi river are already increasing and fear the worst should the blockage break suddenly.  “If the entire blockage is blown away at one go and 25 lakh cusecs of water is discharged all of a sudden, it will bring a deluge in north Bihar,” the DMD Special Secretary said.  On Sunday 3 August 2014 the department ordered evacuations of at least 40,000 people in 9 districts situated along the Kosi river. Thousands still remain in the threatened areas and the Disaster Management Department say they aim to evacuate all of those under threat. The state will receive assistance from India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).  2008 Bihar Floods  The current disaster comes almost exactly 6 years after the 2008 Bihar floods, when the Kosi river broke its banks near the Indo-Nepal border.

More than 400 people were evacuated from flood-hit homes in lower North Island towns across Taranaki, Horowhenua, Manawatu, Rangitikei and Whanganui over the weekend.

Recovery from the flooding could take a month, Whanganui District Council told Radio New Zealand this morning.  ""The next step is to look at ways that we can support our isolated communities as well as help the communities in the urban area clean up,"" Cass Alexander, from the council's communications department, said.

All of the flooding call-outs were now being dealt with by local stations, he said.  ""It's just clean up efforts now really,"" he said.  The damage from the flood in Whanganui could reach tens of millions of dollars, civil defence controller Kevin Ross said.  He told Newstalk ZB there was still more than 400 Whanganui residents out of their homes today.  It was the city's worst flood in recorded history and the city was now in ""clean up mode"", he said.  ""We've estimated 400 out of their houses, that's the assessment we have to do today.  ""It's certainly the biggest flood we've ever had here and I've been here for some time,"" Mr Ross said.  Whanganui was no longer cut off from the rest of country with State Highway 3 open to the north and south, he said.  The flooding is the largest flood event ever recorded in the district, Whanganui Civil Defence said.  The situation was still being assessed, it said in its early morning update today. The focus today would be on identifying rural residents who have not been able to make contact with Civil Defence yet, and who may need assistance, it said.  The Whanganui River level was dropping in the urban area, so work has started on the clean-up operation.  Building inspectors would this morning begin assessing the worst affected urban properties for damage and possible contamination. Residents were warned to treat all flood waters, and areas that had been flooded, as contaminated.  Power has been restored to the Kai Iwi bores, the three major bores which supply the city, and the Westmere reservoirs were now refilling. However, residents were asked to continue to conserve water use.  Excavated areas remain cordoned off, Civil Defence said.  Police are providing mobile units around the city, while the Salvation Army is assisting at welfare centres and the Red Cross has started checking vulnerable residents.  People who were evacuated from their homes were asked not to return home until the property has been assessed and decontaminated if necessary.  Some areas are still without power, or are experiencing disruption to their power supply as repairs are carried out.  Power remained out at Ahu Ahu, Blueskin, Brunswick, Kai Iwi, Paparangi, Rangitatau East, Te Tuhi Junction and Westmere this morning.  It was expected to be restored to all those areas by 6pm.  The Peat St substation was flooded over the weekend but was back up and running by late last night.  Transpower had also been advised of pole issues in Roberts Ave, Civil Defence said.  There were a large number of slips on rural roads, Civil Defence said, while a number of urban roads were still affected by the flooding.  The Dublin Street Bridge is open to service vehicles only, and is unlikely to open to traffic before noon.  The City Bridge is closed until the approaches on both sides of the bridge can be checked and made safe.  ""The bridge itself has been assessed as structurally sound. A decision will then be made on whether the bridge can reopen.""  This was also unlikely to happen before noon.  The Aramoho Rail Bridge walkway was closed.Access is available west and south on State Highway 3, but State Highway 4 (Parapara) is still closed.  Wanganui East residents can now access the city via a loop at the back of the eastern suburbs. The route is expected to be extremely congested this morning, and motorists are being warned to take extreme care and be patient.  At this stage there were no fears for lives, Whanganui mayor Annette Main said.  ""We haven't had calls from people who need immediate help, but we know that people are not able to get out of their homes in the rural areas,"" she said, speaking to Radio New Zealand this morning.  ""We know rural area people are resourceful and usually have supplies, but as days go by and people are unable to get out of their homes because of flood waters, or mostly because of the condition of the roads, then we know that we're going to be putting some other means of getting them out into place, and also getting supplies into them.""  That would most likely be through the use of helicopters she said, as had been used in the past.  ""Some people are happy to stay, because they've got farms or businesses in the area that they need to keep operating, they've got stock, others are keener to come to town and stay in town while they can't get backwards and forwards to their homes.""  The council would today try to make contact with those in rural areas who are cut off by damage to the roads, she said, ""some of which ... will take weeks if not months to repair"".  The army had also offered to help, Ms Main said, which she described as ""fantastic"".  ""We have the offer of the army for assistance where needed.""  People in rural Whanganui might face a month away from their homes and livelihoods after the devastating flooding over the weekend.  Whanganui mayor Annette Main told Newstalk ZB there were ""major issues"" for rural areas.  Some of the roads alone would take months to rebuild and it would be a long time before Ms Main could get back into her own rural property, she said.  ""This is not going to be a quick fix for us,""  ""I have an apartment in town...I'm ok there but there are many people in the rural area who won't be able to get in and out,"" she said.  The mayor told TV3's Paul Henry programme the extent of the damage could be devastating for some residents who relied on rural land for their income.  The damage was worse than the city had ever seen before, she said.  ""People have been through this kind of event before but there will be people whose lives are completely turned upside down staying with friends, wondering what's going to happen.  ""Many of those rural people and farming or running rural businesses, tourism businesses...there's a lot of work going on there that you can't just up and leave.

Briefings are being held this morning to determine the status of the flooding in Whanganui, Rangitikei and Taranaki.  States of local emergency remained in place overnight for the regions after hundreds of people were evacuated due to severe flooding on the weekend.  Civil Defence warned people in all flood-affected areas to stay away from beaches, rivers and streams because of potential contamination.  Whanganui was cut off from the rest of the country due to thousands of large slips but State Highway 3 to the north and south of the city was now open.  In Rangitikei, dozens of people had to be evacuated from the beach community of Koitiata.  A number of Waitotara homes in Taranaki also had to be evacuated after the Waitotara River burst its banks.  In Manawatu, water contamination was expected due to power loss to sewage pumps.  Meanwhile, there had been reports of people who were evacuated from their homes in the Waitotara area being forced to sleep in their cars on Saturday night because emergency accommodation was full, Radio New Zealand reported.  ""They came and got us and evacuated us, told us there was accommodation up in Waverley, but it was all full up, so we slept in our car,"" one resident said.  South Taranaki Mayor Ross Dunlop said there was some confusion caused by the centre first being open at 4pm, closed at 6pm, and then reopening again when the seriousness of the situation became clear.  ""There was enough accommodation for people if they needed it, so I was surprised to hear that some people had stayed the night in their cars,"" he told RNZ.  Other residents were angry at the way they were evacuated from their homes, with one man claiming his grandmother was handcuffed and thrown to the ground by police.  ""Police .... said everyone's getting out, so they grabbed my grandmother and they arrested her,"" he said.  ""They were throwing her around. They just treated all the old people with disrespect.""  His 67-year-old grandmother wasn't ready to leave because her house was unlocked, he said.""  She was saying she wasn't going to go because she's still got her livestock to look after, and the fact that her house wasn't locked up, we still had things to move. They threw her up against the bus .. then they chucked her on the ground. I watched them do that.""  Police confirmed to the broadcaster the woman was handcuffed, but couldn't comment on how she was treated during the process.  A tough weekend for residents  The heartbreak for many residents began after the Whanganui River breached its banks about midnight on Saturday, spilling floodwaters into central Whanganui.  The river then continued to rise to record-breaking levels, with the regional council recording a massive flow of 4740cu m per second at the town bridge at 3am yesterday - higher than the previous record of 4680cu m in 1904. The level peaked at 9.1m, significantly higher than the 7m peak the river usually reaches, even at very high spring tides.  Gene Toyne and husband Chris, who live in a low-lying area near Whanganui Airport, left their property on Saturday afternoon.  Mrs Toyne said they had woken early that morning to find floodwaters lapping around their house, and did all they could to safeguard their property.  ""We sat down for a cup of coffee around 1.30pm, because we hadn't stopped all day, and in less than half an hour the water was coming through the floor.""  The couple had just enough time to grab some clothes, some wine and their two dogs and waded out through waist-deep water.  Mrs Toyne said she hoped to return to the house soon, but was ""dreading"" the condition she might find it in.  Whanganui Mayor Annette Main said things were ""dire"" yesterday morning and floodwaters were higher than anyone had seen before. Two evacuation centres had been opened in Whanganui and about 200 people had been processed there.  Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye visited the flood-stricken city yesterday and promised the Government would contribute to the cost of repairing flood damage.  She saw the damage at Anzac Parade and in the central city shopping area, before heading to nearby flooded regions. Ms Kaye was due to return to Wellington this morning, ready to brief the Cabinet.  States of local emergency remained in place last night for Whanganui, Rangitikei and Taranaki.  Civil Defence warned people in all flood-affected areas to stay away from beaches, rivers and streams because of potential contamination due to the heavy rain and flooding.  In Manawatu, water contamination was expected due to power loss to sewage pumps.  In Taranaki, a number of homes in Waitotara had to be evacuated after the Waitotara River burst its banks.  Kim Lewis, who lives on the Whanganui side of the river, said fire crews visited her at 11pm on Saturday with an evacuation order. However, she chose to stay at home to take care of her livestock and her dogs.  In Rangitikei, dozens more people had to be evacuated from the beach community of Koitiata.  Rangitikei Mayor Andy Watson said people were ""scared"" as the floodwaters rose on Saturday night.  ""You have people in houses, it's dark, the water is suddenly rising and they don't know where it's going to stop so they're frightened.""  The Club Hotel in Marton was ""bursting at the seams"" with evacuees and stranded travellers on Saturday night, said owner Sandy Beaman.  ""Some people were a bit downhearted because it turns out they didn't have any domestic insurance cover. But that's just one of those life things, isn't it?""  A number of highways remained closed last night, including parts of State Highway 3, which were closed yesterday due to slips and flooding. SH1 had been closed between Bulls and Hunterville but was reopened last night. Transport authorities warned drivers to take care.  Cold arrives for darkest days of year  Icy temperatures and severe frosts will replace the heavy rain that caused flooding chaos over the weekend.  Rain will continue to fall across the lower North Island today, but it won't be as heavy as the rainfall which led to the rapidly rising floodwaters.  ""The good news is things are looking much more settled over the next couple of days,"" MetService meteorologist John Law told Radio New Zealand.  ""We've still got showers for today, but nowhere near as much rainfall as we've seen over the last few days.""  However, temperatures were likely to fall over the next few days, bringing a cold blast across the country, particularly in the South Island.  Mr Law said an area of low pressure had produced ""an awful lot of rain in very small spots"" across the lower North Island over the weekend, leading to the widespread flooding.  ""It was all blocked by a large area of high pressure to the north, and that cold air we had down south as well.""  MetService meteorologist Emma Blades warned temperatures are set to drop.  ""Temperatures will drop across the whole country over the next couple of days, with severe frosts forecast for sheltered places.  ""Add the wind chill factor from strong winds in the east and it's going to start to feel bitterly cold for some.""  Ms Blades said night temperatures in Timaru could drop to around -9C the week. The town's average minimum temperature was 0C for this time of year.  Heavy snow is expected in southern Fiordland, Southland, and southern parts of Otago, including Clutha and Dunedin.  Areas around the Canterbury Plains north of Ashburton were likely to get snow near to sea level, she said.  The strong southerly flow would also bring heavy swells to exposed coasts over the next couple of days before easing.  Large swells could persist around Hawkes Bay and Gisborne until the end of the week.  WeatherWatch was anticipating severe frosts, with analyst Philip Duncan saying cold rather than snow would be the main focus this week.  ""Last week ended warm for many - this week will not be the same. Welcome to winter - and to the start of the coldest, darkest eight weeks of the year.""

226,408,disaster,"A devastating flood which destroyed over 200 houses in Onuebonyi Inyimagu, Abakaliki and Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State has reportedly led to the death of about two persons. The flood came as a result of a three-day downpour, which submerged houses as well as destroyed property and economic trees, while many families were also displaced.  Eyewitness account has it that the flood was induced by an overflow of Ebonyi River into Izzi River in which several communities were affected and foodstuffs, farmlands with household property worth millions of naira destroyed.  According to one of those affected, Okoroafor Nwenyim, the flood pulled down his house, rendering him and other residents homeless. He described the incident as the worst in the area.  Meanwhile, victims of the flood have appealed to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to come to their rescue with temporary accommodation. Also, they urged that Ebonyi River should be dredged to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.  Narrating their ordeal, another victim said: “I noticed water entering our house around 3a.m. I thought it was not much, until it submerged the whole house. We could not salvage anything from the house. We slept outside because we had nowhere to go. We appeal to the state government to come to our aid because in my case, I don’t know where to go with my children.”  Another victim identified as Mrs Agnes Ozigbo lamented: “It was a terrible experience. What we discovered was that the water from Ebonyi River overflowed its bank, thereby causing devastating flood around this area. Just take a look at the level of destruction; we are still looking for two of our children. Our sheep, foodstuffs and farmland were destroyed.”  DailyPost was made to understand that other places affected by the flood includes: Anglican Church at Unagboke village, Azuiyiokwu in Abakaliki Local Government Area of the state.",http://dailypost.ng/2014/09/30/flood-wreaks-havoc-ebonyi-destroys-200-houses/,en
227,411,disaster,"Flooding caused by ongoing heavy rains across southern Nigeria caused at least 15 fatalities in the last week of June 2014.  Heavy rains on 28 and 29 June affected Oyo State in southwestern Nigeria, where at least ten people drowned when a makeshift bridge in the Apete area of Ibadan suddenly collapsed into floodwaters. Several people were rescued from the overflowing river by onlookers. The original bridge linking the Ijokodo community to the Apete area collapsed during flooding in August 2011 and a temporary bridge was erected in the interim. Following last week’s drownings resulting from the collapse of the wooden pillars supporting the temporary bridge, street protests were held by locals angry at the slow pace of reconstruction.  Prof. Joseph Olowofela, Caretaker Chairman of Ido Local Government, described the incident as unfortunate, adding that the state government is funding the contract to construct a new bridge, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.  Another five people, including three children, have died in flooding near the Olodo River. They were sheltering in a church building when it was submerged by floodwaters. It was reported on 30 June that one body had been recovered so far.  Meanwhile, in Calabar, capital of Cross Rivers State in the southeast of Nigeria, last week’s heavy rains and resulting flooding are reported to have caused the collapse of 60 homes and public facilities in the areas of Ikot Ansa, Ikot Eneobong, Ikot Nkebre and Big Qua Town, as well as parts of Calabar South.  The Deputy Director of Information of the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, David Akate, said in a statement that the flooding was “attributed to the blockage of drains and other water ways as well as the construction of buildings along flood-prone areas.”  The statement quoted SEMA Director-General Vincent Aquah as advising motorists to stay clear of flooded roads and warning parents not to allow children to play around flooded drainage infrastructure and areas of ponding water, and exhorting residents to adhere to the campaign against indiscriminate waste disposal.

229,429,conflict,"IDPs are mainly concentrated in the country’s north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) (up to 1.5 million), but also live in Balochistan province and other parts of Pakistan (up to 275,000). Numbers likely underestimate the scale of displacement as they exclude unregistered IDPs living in KP and FATA and IDPs living in other parts of Pakistan, including in urban centres such as Karachi.  The estimate is based on a combination of sources. For KP and FATA, UNHCR regularly publishes information on numbers of displaced families who are registered as such, based on data provided by provincial authorities (UNHCR, KP and FATA IDP Statistics as of 31 March 2015, on file with IDMC). To calculate the number of individuals displaced, IDMC uses an average family size of 5.2.  No one regularly monitors internal displacement in Balochistan, and IDMC’s estimate is based on information available from media sources (The News, 28 July 2010; ICG, 23 January 2014, p.14; IRIN, 13 February 2014).  IDMC’s estimate of the total number of IDPs likely underestimates the real situation. It does not include IDPs in KP and FATA who are not registered as such. People who become displaced but do not hold a computerised national identity card (CNIC), have two addresses, or whose CNIC contains faulty information such as a duplicate family number are not eligible to register as IDPs. Further, only those IDPs whose home areas the government has declared to be “calamity-hit” are registered as IDPs (OCHA, 7 August 2014, p.7; OCHA, 18 June 2014, p.1).  The Internally Displaced Person Vulnerability Assessment & Profiling (IVAP), an independent project set up in 2010 to profile IDPs, recently found that about half of the IDPs covered by its profiling in KP and FATA were not registered (IDMC interview, January 2015). Further, no information is available on IDPs from KP and FATA who live in other areas of the country, including urban areas.  In KP and FATA, the majority of IDPs live with host communities, and just over 42,400 people are in camps. Available data disaggregated by age and gender suggests that 31 per cent are boys and 23 per cent girls, while 21 and 22 per cent are adult men and women under the age of 60, respectively. 2 and 1 per cent are older men and women (UNHCR, KP and FATA IDP Statistics as of 31 March 2015, on file with IDMC). No disaggregated data was available for IDPs elsewhere in Pakistan.  The country has also experienced large-scale displacement as a result of disasters brought on by natural hazards, mainly floods. From 2008 to 2013 disasters displaced a total of 13.76 million people, placing Pakistan fourth worldwide in absolute terms. Relative to its population it ranked sixth, with almost 13,000 people per million inhabitants displaced (IDMC, 17 September 2014, pp.32-33).  Conflict-related displacement since 2004 has been caused by fighting between the Pakistani military and non-state armed groups (NSAGs), clashes between NSAGs, sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims, tribal and local clashes over resources, and human rights abuses committed by both the military and NSAGs (IDMC, 12 June 2013, pp.3, 5; IDMC, 10 January 2012, pp.3, 8; The Friday Times, March 2012; HRCP, March 2013, p.279; IDMC, 6 September 2010, pp.21-24; AI, 2012; AI, June 2010, pp.11-15; ICG, 23 June 2014, pp.13-15; BBC, 22 February 2014; IRIN, 13 February 2014; Reuters, 21 May 2014). Information on numbers of IDPs in FATA and KP is regularly updated, while numbers on Balochistan are scarcer.  Of the total number, up to 907,000 were newly displaced in 2014, all of them from FATA’s North Waziristan and Khyber agencies. This compares to 140,000; 412,000; 190,000; 400,000 and 3 million newly displaced in the five preceding years. The total number of people in displacement peaked at 3 million in 2009 (IDMC, 14 May 2014, p.74; IDMC, 29 April 2013, p.70; IDMC, 2 April 2012, p.90; IDMC, 1 March 2011, p.92; IDMC, 1 May 2010, p.82). Some of the current IDPs were displaced as early as 2005 (from Balochistan) or 2007 (from KP’s Hangu district) (IRIN, 13 February 2014; IDMC interview, October 2014).  At least 104,000 returned in 2014, including up to 46,000 registered IDPs in KP and FATA, 55,000 newly displaced from FATA’s North Waziristan agency in January and March 2014 who were not registered as IDPs, and more than 3,161 IDPs from Balochistan (UNHCR Returns Fact Sheet as of 31 December 2014, on file with IDMC; OCHA, 18 June 2014, p.1; IRIN, 13 February 2014).

230,430,disaster,"Gaza  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, has declared an Emergency in Gaza City, following extreme weather and severe flooding over the past 48 hours. No casualties or injuries have been reported, however hundreds of residents in the flooded areas around the Sheikh Radwan storm water lagoon have evacuated their homes. One UNRWA school and an UNRWA Collective Centre in Gaza City have been affected by the rising waters.  The Agency has established an Area Emergency Operations room in Gaza City following contingency planning undertaken last week. As the largest UN agency in the Gaza Strip, UNRWA utilizes its procurement and logistical capacity to supply emergency fuel to municipalities, water, sanitation and health facilities, partially through the WASH and Health clusters (led by UNICEF and WHO). Today, UNRWA provided 60,000 litres emergency fuel supplies to run back-up generators of pumping stations and portable pumps. UNRWA is also prepared to provide adequate shelter to internally displaced refugees and non refugees should there be a need.  Gaza City is one of five areas in the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave where UNRWA serves some 1.3 million Palestine refugees across all Areas. Of the 18 UNRWA Collective Centres, 5 are in Gaza City and currently provide adequate shelter for some 7,000 people displaced by the recent and devastating conflict.  As a precautionary measure, 63 schools in Gaza City are closed today for the afternoon shift, affecting almost 65,000 students. Forty-three schools in the North Area of the Strip are also now closed. Other UNRWA installations are still being assessed, though no damage has yet been reported.  UNRWA is in close consultation with all of its partners, the Palestinian Government and the local municipality who are monitoring the level of rain across the Strip.  ""We are very concerned about such severe storms this early in the season and on the back of unprecedented damage and destruction caused by the recent conflict,” said UNRWA’s Director of Operations Robert Turner in Gaza. “We are particularly concerned for those families still seeking adequate shelter and preparing for the winter months, and for the impact the flooding is already having on children unable to attend school.”  The devastation that extreme weather can cause is not new for Palestinian families in Gaza. In December 2013, the fiercest winter storm the region has seen for many years, Alexa, hit the Strip, and brought torrential rains and widespread flooding that displaced thousands. Such devastation exacerbates the already poor humanitarian situation for refugees and non-refugees in Gaza, which is dealing with the aftermath of a recent conflict, and an acute fuel and energy crisis.  UNRWA continues to closely monitor the situation.",http://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-declares-emergency-gaza-city-due-extreme-weather-and-flooding,en

Recent inter-communal violence in the Kagua-Erave area has left at least 40 people dead and 30 wounded.  The aid distributed today will help ensure the displaced families are able to meet their basic needs. ""Our people have been desperate for assistance,"" said Justin Mapi, a leader of one of the displaced clans. ""This is the only help we have received since the fighting began. We have lost everything.""  Following an outbreak of violence between the Wambea and Kombia clans in late 2013, the ICRC donated medical supplies to Kagua Health Centre and Sumbura Aid Post, as well as directly to the clans, to help treat the wounded. The ICRC also took one woman wounded in a grenade attack to Mount Hagen Provincial Hospital.  ""We are particularly concerned about access to health-care facilities for people injured in clan fighting across the Highlands,"" said Gauthier Lefèvre, head of the ICRC’s mission in Papua New Guinea. ""Many wounded people are afraid to travel to health centres for fear of attack by enemy fighters. A number of health centres in the area have been destroyed or abandoned after years of fighting, and appropriate care is often only available in provincial capitals far removed from the site of clashes.""  The ICRC has been working in Kagua Erave District in partnership with the Papua New Guinea Red Cross since 2011, helping communities affected by clan fighting. In November 2013, the ICRC distributed construction and gardening tools to 749 families from the Apopa and Pawayamo clans to help them return to their lands after making peace. It held three first-aid training courses for communities and local police in affected areas throughout 2013. In neighbouring Uma village, the ICRC is helping build a health post to serve the community of Aiya LLG, which has been without any treatment facility since 2005.  The ICRC mission in Papua New Guinea has been operating since 2007.

235,445,conflict,"IDMC’s estimate is based on figures collected among various stakeholders met during a mission to PNG in October 2014, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), local authorities, provincial disaster management representatives and a relocation project coordinator. Other sources include Amnesty International (AI) and the media.    The number of people newly displaced by conflict in 2014 is unknown. According to data gathered by IOM between October 2013 and June 2014, a total of 1,800 people were displaced in 7 conflict-related incidents while 14 disasters displaced some 17,000 people (IOM, on file with IDMC, 6 August 2014). IOM collected its figures based on its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) methodology (IDMC interviews, October 2014).  Conflict-related displacement  IDMC’s estimate of 7,500 IDPs includes 4,000 people displaced by ethnic clashes in May 2010 in Bulolo district, Morobe province and who have since remained living in a camp in Bulolo town. Another 300 people, displaced in September 2013, also by ethnic clashes have since been living in an informal settlement close to the Bulolo river. The sources for these two figures are the Bulolo IDP camp coordinator and a representative of the Morobe provincial disaster office (IDMC mission, October 2014; PNG Loop, 27 December 2013)).  In Kagua Erave district, Southern Highlands Province, some 2,000 people forced to flee their homes at the end of 2013 due to ethnic clashes remained displaced with host families. The source for this estimate is ICRC who has been assisting the IDPs since their displacement (IDMC interviews, October 2014; ICRC, 24 January 2014).  The estimate also includes 1,200 people forcibly evicted by the police in June 2014 in Wingima, near the Porgera gold mine in Enga province (AI, 21 August 2014). The number was calculated based on the fact that each of the 200 homes destroyed housed one family and that the average household size in rural areas in Papua New Guinea is at least 6 (CARE, October 2011, p. 25).  Natural-hazard-related displacement  The number of people displaced by natural hazard-related disasters is estimated at 15,000. They consist of Manam islanders displaced by a volcanic eruption in 2004 and who have since been living in 3 camps in Bogia and Sumkar districts, Madang province. The population breakdown for the 3 camps is as following:  Mangem care center: 4,000 IDPs  Assuramba care center: 3,000 IDPs  Potsdam care center: 8,000 IDPs  The source for this figure is Paul Akuram, Manam relocation project coordinator. The figure is the result of a survey carried out in 2014 by the local authorities (IDMC interviews, October 2014). In 2012, a Local Level Government (LLG) representative estimated the number of IDPs in the care centers at between 15,000 and 16,000 (ABC, 26 September 2012).  Figures limitations  IDMC’s estimates are conservative as many displacement incidents remain under-reported. Data collection on the number or needs of IDPs in PNG is a major challenge in the absence of any comprehensive monitoring of displacement at the national level. Disaster monitoring and data collection systems are weak and disaster management at the provincial level local level is constrained by poor resources and capacity (WB, 2010, p. 11).  There is also no clear IDP definition at the national level and available data on natural hazard-related disasters does not distinguish between people who are “affected” and “displaced”. Moreover, data collection is hampered by lack of access. Ethnic clashes, the main cause of conflict-related displacement, often take place in remote areas where access is hindered by difficult terrain but also by ongoing insecurity, in particular in the Highlands region.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.",http://www.internal-displacement.org/south-and-south-east-asia/papua-new-guinea/figures-analysis,en

Paraguay’s National Emergency Secretariat (SEN) in coordination with the local disaster authority, Consejo Municipal de Emergencias y Desastres de Asunción (Comueda), have carried out the evacuations from the low-lying bañados areas of the city, in particular Bañado Norte.  SEN said on Wednesday that, “the number of families affected by the flooding in the capital already exceeded 7,000, after the level of the Paraguay river increased by 113 cm in just 17 days…”  The families are being houses in over 70 temporary shelters. Food kits have been distributed by Comueda, who said yesterday that the number of evacuated families had grown to 8,713 families. According to Comueda, 3,910 of these families have been evacuated from the Bañado Sur area, and 4,803 from Bañado Norte.  As of 30 July 2015, Administración Nacional de Navegación y Puertos (ANNP) report that the Paraguay river stood at 6.13 metres at Asunción, having fallen 2 cm in the last 24 hours. Flood levels is 5.50 metres.  Higher than normal rainfall in the north and east of Paraguay during July caused the significant increase of the Paraguay river levels. According to ECHO, the Paraguay river has also overflowed in the departments of San Pedro and Guaira.  This is the second time in the space of a few weeks that large-scale evacuations have been carried out in the city as a result of flooding or the threat of flooding. In early June 2015, 4,917 families in the low-lying bañados areas of the city were evacuated as a precaution after levels of the Paraguay river rose to 5.45 metres.",http://floodlist.com/america/paraguay-evacuation-asuncion-paraguay-river-overflows.  ,en

Some 130,000 people have been forced from their homes across Paraguay, officials said, as President Horacio Cartes declared a state of emergency to free up more than $3.5 million in disaster funds.  Three people traveling Paraguay's international Route 2, which links Asuncion and Foz de Iguazu in Brazil were killed when a tree fell on their vehicle before dawn.  Another woman traveling by motorcycle in Asuncion was killed by a falling tree overnight, official sources told AFP.  The National Emergency Secretariat (SEN) reported a dozen other similar incidents in the capital.  The agency's head of operations, David Arellano, said rescue and evacuation operations were underway for dozens of families in the face of floodwaters from the Paraguay River.  Around the capital Asuncion 125,000 homes were without power and 17 power distribution centers knocked out across the country.  Northeastern Argentina also reported widespread disruption and one fatality from the worst flooding in half a century.  A 13-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power cable while trying to assess storm damage to his home in the city of Corrientes, local media reported.  In Entre Rios province at least 10,000 people were evacuated, with Concordia, a city of some 170,000 on the banks of the Uruguay River, the worst affected with nonstop rain throughout the night, Mayor Enrique Crest said.  ""This is the worst flooding in 50 years,"" he said, adding that although ""flooding was predicted due to El Nino, no one thought that it would be so substantial.""  The city is located 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the Salto Grande dam, which was helping to hold the waters back, but was nearing its full capacity, Crest said.  The governor of Entre Rios said the total number of evacuees across the province could rise to ""between 16,000 to 20,000.""  Argentina's vice president, Gabriela Michetti, traveled Thursday to the affected region to view the damage and assess disaster relief needs.  The country has declared a state of emergency for the Panama, Uruguay and Paraguay rivers and their tributaries, following exceptionally high rainfall.  In November and December, the Rio de la Plata river basin in Argentina's northeast received between 150 and 300 millimeters more rain than is typical for the period, the farm industry ministry said in a statement.  Uruguay on Wednesday also declared a state of emergency in three northern departments affected by flooding.

238,451,disaster,"Heavy rainfall over the last week has brought further flooding to parts of Peru.  On 28 February 2014, two rivers in the Huánuco region of Peru overflowed. The Huampal and Pozuzo burst their banks in the province of Puerta Inca, forcing over 30 families to leave their homes to find safer, higher ground.  Two days later, the river Tauli overflowed in the the district of Conchucos, province of Pallasca, Anchash region. Over 300 people were affected. Roads in the area are impassable and around 20 houses have been damaged, with at least five of them destroyed. Emergency accommodation has been set up for the displaced in a local school, the emergency Institution Virgen del Carmen. The regional government and Peru’s Civil Defence are providing food and aid. Work is also being carried out on the river in order to prevent further flooding.  More heavy rains and storms are expected over the next 2 days. The severe weather is most likely to affect areas further east in central Peru.  Floods and Drought  Perus has endured a period of weather extremes during the last few months, with some areas experiencing floods and others drought.  A state of emergency was declared in the Peru region of Madre de Dios after heavy rainfall on 27 January caused the Tambopata and Madre de Dios rivers to overflow.  Meanwhile, the far north western region of Tumbes, which lies on the border with Ecuador, is experiencing a drought severe enough to be putting livestock and crops at risk.  The district mayor, Rodrigo Astudillo Merino told local media that around 50% of the region’s famring is affected, with 70,000 livestock and over 300 hectares of crops are at risk.

The heavy rain caused the Huallaga and Huayabamba rivers to overflow, inundating around 3,000 hectares of farmland, as well as causing damage to homes and property.  The rain has been falling for several days. The Regional Government of San Martin, in co-ordination with INDECI, have been helping shore up flood defences and distribute relief supplies, including tents, sandbags, blankets and food rations since 20 January.

241,455,disaster,"The heavy rain and resulting floods and landslides have prompted the government in Peru to declare a state of emergency in Tumbes, Cajamarca, Lima, Tacna and Moquegua regions over the last week.  Further rainfall has been forecast until 05 April 2015. Some river levels remain high, particularly in the north of the country, and alerts have been issued.  At least 22 people have been killed in floods and landslides since the heavy rainfall began around 22 March 2015. There are many people still missing. These figures are likely to change as more thorough assessments are carried out. Floods and numerous landslides have blocked roads, and authorities are yet to reach some of the affected areas.  Tumbes Region  As of 30 March 2015, the government of Peru officially declared state of emergency in the Tumbes region.  Heavy rainfall since 26 March 2015 has caused landslides, mudslides and increased flow of rivers and tributaries in the region in the country’s far north. The Tumbes and Zarumilla rivers have overflowed, damaging houses, roads and infrastructure in the three provinces of the region (Contralmirante Villar, Tumbes and Zarumilla).  At least 500 homes and hundreds of hectares of crops have been affected in several districts of the region, reported the regional president, Ricardo Flores Dioses,as quoted in local media. The technical secretary of the Regional Emergency Operations (COER), Eduardo Arbulú said that in this region there nearly 1,900 families affected by the rains.  Flooding has also caused widespread damage to crops in the region, affecting over 6,000 producers, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MINAGRI), who said that over 7,500 hectares of rice, organic bananas, cocoa and lemons have all suffered damage.  On 29 March 2015, Peru’s meteorological agency, SENAMHI, recorded flow of the Zarumilla river to be 1362.07 m3 per second, which is the highest recorded since last year and more than twice the normal flow.  INDECI, Peru’s civil protection agency, has recommended that residents living in areas along the Zarumilla river to relocate to safe areas on higher ground.  Cajamarca Region  La Republica are reporting that at least 14 people have died in landslides in Cajamarca region since the recent heavy rains began.  Five people died in a landslide in Nuevo Horizonte, Sócota, and three in a landslide in Santa Cruz de Cutervo. Landslides and floods have destroyed roads and have made areas of the region inaccessible. On the road linking Cutervo to Jaén there have been as many as 30 landslides. La Republica say that other victims died as they were unable to reach a hospital and receive medical care in time. Districts including Choros, Sacilia, Cujillo, Toribio Casanova, La Ramada and La Capilla are either completely or partially cut off.  On 28 March 2015, the central government declared a state of emergency lasting 60 days for 21 districts affected by heavy rains, floods and landslides in Cajamarca region.  The affected districts include Jaén, Colasay, San Luis de Lucma, Choros, Socota, Callayuc, Cutervo, La Ramada, Santa Cruz, Toribio Casanova, Santo Domingo de La Capilla and Querocotillo.  Local media say that around 15,000 people near Jaén have been cut off after a river overflowed, blocking an important road. INDECI say that 232 families in Jaén have been made homeless by the floods and landslides.  Almost 4,000 hectares of crops have been damaged in Chota and Cutervo provinces in the region.  Lima Region  In Lima region, landslides occurred in the district of Lurigancho-Chosica on 23 March, killing eight people and injuring 25, while another six people were still missing and over 150 houses were destroyed, as of 24 March 2015.  Media say that as many as 13 landslides have been recorded in Chosica since 23 March 2015. The floods and landslides were caused by torrential rainfall on 23 March 2015 which, according to some reports, lasted or over 6 hours.  Another landslide occurred in Huarochiri province of Lima on the same day, injuring 30 people and destroying 110 houses.  The landslides blocked major roads linking Lima to the central Andes. Chosica also suffered severe flooding after the Rimac river overflowed. Levels of the river have since started to fall, according to a report of 31 March 2015 from SENAMHI.  The road has since re-opened and a state of national emergency was declared in Chosica surrounding areas on 25 March 2015 in order to allow quicker access to relief and repair funds. The President of Peru and local authorities have visited the zone and are assisting the affected population in coordination with INDECI and other state authorities.  Practical Action Flood Resilience Project  Practical Action, the development charity, currently has a team of people working in the Chosica district of Lima.  Colin McQuistan, policy and practice advisor on disaster risk reduction and climate change said: “The fatalities have been from informal communities located high up in the river basin. They have been hit by both mud avalanches and erosion of the land on which they live.  “This is a poor area of Lima. Along the river temporary and unofficial housing is growing and coming ever closer to the river bank. We have been working with the municipal government and local community leaders to put in place reliable effective methods of evacuation, to ensure housing is better able to withstand this type of event and to improve the ability of people to recover their livelihoods after flooding or landslides”.  Practical Action has been working in the affected area for the last few months, initiating a project designed to make those living on the banks of the Rio Rimac more resilient to flooding and better prepared to cope when a disaster strikes.  About the project, Colin McQuistan said:  “Unfortunately, the project is still in its early stages and our work has mainly been with communities lower down the river basin and not those affected by the landslides. So while we have not been able to prevent the loss of life this time, we believe that in future people near to the Rio Rimac will be far better equipped to survive such floods.  “It is ironic that this has happened just days after the World Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan where we argued strongly that urban development must take into account climate change and the threat of disasters such as flooding.  “Poverty, vulnerability and disasters are linked”  “Poverty, vulnerability and disasters are linked – it is most often the poorest that are worst affected and suffer most. Their poverty makes them more vulnerable. Their capacity to cope with disasters and recover from the effects are constrained by their lack of resources. But if their risk is managed then dramatic flood events need not turn into tragic disasters.”  The project is one of a number Practical Action has been implementing in communities vulnerable to climate change throughout the world as part of the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance programme.  Video of the floods in Chosica, Peru:  Tacna Region  Heavy rain resulted in floods and landslides in district of Ilabaya, province of Jorge Basadre in Tacna region on 26 March 2015.

The parties are now working with the documents, deciding on the cost and the choice of the construction site,” Vladislav Bakumenko said at the government’s meeting.  Agriculture and Food Minister of Belarus Leonid Zayats who leads the Belarusian delegation that arrived to Amur Oblast on 1 March noted that the issue pertains 65 houses. “These are wooden houses from Belarusian natural wood. They only need to be assembled here (in Amur Oblast). It takes five days to assemble a house of the kind,” Leonid Zayats said.  In his words, Belarus suggests three designs – 42, 60 and 90 square meters.  According to Governor of Amur Oblast Oleg Kozhemyako, a large-scale construction of houses in the flood-hit region will start on 12 March.  A total of 120 apartments have been purchased at the secondary market for the flood victims in Amur Oblast. According to the Ministry of Construction and Architecture of Amur Oblast, there should be constructed 104 municipal and 106 private houses by 30 September 2014.

252,508,conflict,"This figure includes IDPs who fled both Chechen wars (1994-1996 and 1999-2000), as well as those who fled North Ossetia’s Prigorodny region in 1992 after clashes between ethnic Ingush and Ossetians. The estimate includes:  - 378 people who fled North Osssetia, Chechnya and Ingushetia and were granted “forced migrant” status by the government from 2005 to 2014;  - 15,000 IDPs in Chechnya  - 10,000 IDPs in Ingushetia  IDMC considers that the number of IDPs is likely to be higher for three reasons.  First, the figure may not include a few thousand IDPs who have been able to renew their “forced migrant” status since it was first granted.  Second, the government uses a more restrictive definition of an internally displaced person than the one outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. According to its 1995 Law on Forced Migrants, a “forced migrant” is a person displaced between provinces of the Russian Federation. Those displaced within a province of the Russian Federation are not eligible for “forced migrant” status. As a result, government figures do not take into account people displaced within Chechnya and North Ossetia.  Third, in practice many people who fled from Chechnya to another province did not receive “forced migrant” status even though they were eligible according to the Law on Forced Migrants. As a result, government figures do not take into account people displaced to Dagestan, or most ethnic Chechens, who fled from Chechnya during the second conflict.  Fourth, “forced migrant” status expires after five years according to the Law on Forced Migrants. The holder can extend it on an annual basis thereafter, but this has proven difficult for many IDPs due to inconsistent application of the law. Some IDPs have applied to the court to have their status extended, but not all have been successful.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.",http://www.internal-displacement.org/europe-the-caucasus-and-central-asia/russian-federation/figures-analysis,en

The Solomon's National Disaster Council says the victims who lost their homes occupying 24 evacuation centres around Honiara.  The National Emergency Operations Centre says the numbers are continuing to increase across all centres.  The director of the National Disaster Management Office, Loti Yates, has raised concerns over sanitation at the evacuation centres, which are lacking proper water supply.  ""There is a very real risk of an outbreak of disease - including dyentry, malaria, dengue fever and other diseases related to poor sanitation,"" Mr Yates said.  Sorry, this video has expired Video: World Vision says more international assistance required (ABC News)  The Solmon Islands government has allocated $5million in emergency funds for the relief effort.  Australia and New Zealand have sent aircraft, equipment and specialist teams, as well as money, to assist in the clean up.  Cherise Chadwick from Solomon Islands Red Cross has told Asia Pacific thousands are still in evacuation centres in the capital, Honiara.  ""Many of those people are not sure what they're returning back to,"" she said.  ""They left their houses as the flooding was in process, and they haven't gone back yet, so it's very hard to know if they're going back to a damaged house, or a completely destroyed house at this stage.""  Honiara has been effectively split in two, after the Old China Town bridge completely collapsed on Thursday, and the Mataniko bridge was reduced to one lane.  Major infrastructure including the sewerage system and water supplies have been badly damaged or destroyed.  Ms Chadwick says that's a major worry for those in evacuation centres.  ""We're quite concerned about the possibility of outbreaks of disease due to the problem of water access - as many of these evacuation centres are schools, there's limited water in those schools.  ""The main water network has also been heavily disrupted, so we're trying to get the main water network up and running, but that's obviously taking some time.""  Solomon Islands National Disaster Council says 40,000 people in Guadalcanal are also estimated to have been affected by the disaster.  Assessment teams are being sent to the province, but Ms Chadwick says it remains difficult to access the disaster hit regions.  ""Guadalcanal province itself has been very difficult to access to really get a sense of what actually is the situation out there.  ""We do know that there's been extensive flooding, but obviously access has hampered the efforts to go in and see what the situation is there, but we are expecting a similar situation.""  World Vision Solomon Islands national director Andrew Catford said a greater level of international support will be required.  ""One of the things that can hamper relief efforts is the funding doesn't come in as quickly as what you're having to implement, and certainly that's been the case so far,"" he said.  ""Given the scale of this, 12,000 people in Honiara, 40,000 approximately in rural areas, it's going to be not a terribly cheap exercise to get those people back on their feet.""

According to county commissioner Dau Akoi, the dykes around the villages, some of which were constructed by the Jonglei Food Security Program (JFSP), a project implemented by Catholic Relief Service (CRS) with USAID funding, have been washed down.  Akoi described the current situation in the area as a disaster.  “People are displaced to higher places in Baping and Dong. Houses fell and more will collapse in water. You rarely the see the ground, there is water all over,” he told Sudan Tribune on Thursday.  He said 17 villages in Nyuak, Kongor and Lith payams (districts) are badly affected by flooding.  The raising levels of the Nile water is also threatening the county’s primary dyke after rupturing it in three places.  While community members in Kongor had repaired one of the holes, water was flowing freely in another two areas.  “The flow of water is heavy and dangerous to people who may try to close them. This even makes the situation worse,” the commissioner said.  Despite flooding across large areas of the county, the airstrip, which is being closely monitored by the community, has so far remained dry.

Amongst the turmoil of civil war in one of the world’s youngest countries, flooding has added to the misery of some of the 700,000 internally displaced people (IDP) in South Sudan.  On the night of Friday 7 March 2014, heavy rain and strong wind struck the capital city, Juba, leaving extensive areas of one of the two IDP sites immersed in floodwaters and thick mud.  The storm, which lasted only an hour, flattened 646 shelters in the U.N. Tomping Displacement Camp, leaving 8,000 of the 23,000 residents living in flood conditions. Concerned that further rains would worsen conditions, as another big storm was expected, UN International Rescue Committee (IRC) staff have recommended that 10,000 people relocate to the other IDP site in Juba, “UN House”, but people are reluctant to move, said IRC South Sudan Country Director Wendy Taeuber.

267,536,disaster,"The Val d’Aran’s Syndic – who is the main authority of the County’s General Council –, Carlos Barrera, described the situation on Tuesday evening as “extremely severe and complicated”. The Aran Syndic emphasised that the measures adopted since Friday have ensured that no casualties have happened, despite the severe floods, “which is the most important thing”. “Everybody had many hours to react and this has been a key factor in not having to regret casualties now”, he said. However, he regretted the “colossal” material losses caused by the water. Barrera told the CNA that the Town Hall of Vielha is monitoring the evolution of the Nere River, which crosses the old town, in case they have to evacuate. The town is also crossed by the Garonne River, which rises in the Val d’Aran and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean near Bordeaux.  Work continues to protect areas and properties from the water  Barrera also explained that machines have been working and will continue to work during the night at critical points, such as bridges, to prevent them being blocked and to allow water to continue flowing under them. In addition, extra walls are being built to save areas from the water. This is the case in the industrial area of Mijaran, in Vielha. The water has reached the N-230 road, going from the town to the French border, and a wall is being built diagonally to bring the water towards the river again. The road is closed between kilometres 164 and 187, and therefore the main road communication between the Val d’Aran and France is cut.  Houses and bridges destroyed by the wild mountain rivers  Many people have been evacuated from their homes, since they were at risk. By the end of Tuesday, more than 500 will have to sleep out of their beds. Evacuations have taken place in Les, Bòssost, Arties, Naut Aran and Vielha, among other villages. For instance, the people of Naut Aran will spend the night at a sports pavilion. In addition, the inhabitants of seven houses that have been totally flooded will spent the night in a hotel. A house in Arties has collapsed, as well as another one in Casarilh. In addition, a restaurant in Salardú has the wild waters of the river running right through it. In fact, since it is an area located at a high altitude with high mountain peaks, there are a lot of white waters and rivers tend to transport water in a dangerous way. Now, since they are carrying much more water than normal, the rivers are simply a wild torrent of brown rough waters, mud and branches. The water is so violent that three bridges have been destroyed in Casarilh, Escunyau and Arties.  In fact, the rivers are currently transporting between 10 and 20 times the average volume they have during the year. The Noguera Pallaresa is transporting 160 cubic metres per second and the Noguera Ribagorçana 190. In lower lands they are preparing themselves for the water that will arrive. For instance, the Riba-roja reservoir in Southern Catalonia, on the Ebro River, is releasing 1,400 cubic metres of water per second, as the water from the Western Catalan Pyrenees discharges into the Ebro. The Segre River, passing through the city of Lleida, is already registering high levels of water with 208 cubic metres per second but is expected to reach 500 cubic metres on Wednesday.  Avoiding unnecessary trips  The Catalan Government has insisted that people must not return to their homes until they are told. In addition, only strictly necessary trips are advisable in the area, in order not to put people at risk and to allow emergency services to concentrate on evacuations and building defences against the water. Fire-fighters, police officers and civil protection workers from other areas of Catalonia have been transferred to the affected counties.

South Darfur — A downpour has destroyed more than 100 houses in a camp for the displaced near Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, on Sunday.  El Salam camp Sheikh Mahjoub Adam Tabeldiya said that the rains were accompanied by severe winds that lasted for more than four hours. The storm has destroyed houses and left the affected families out in the open without shelter. Tabeldiya appealed, through Radio Dabanga, to the humanitarian organisations, to provide humanitarian assistance and other shelter materials to the families.  In Kalma camp, torrential rains, also accompanied by strong winds, destroyed four classrooms of a mixed basic school. They usually accommodated about 400 students in Square 2.  Sheikh Ali Abdelrahman El Taher, the head of the camp, added that the heavy rainfall has destroyed four houses in Square 5 and four cottages that belong to the World Food Programme.  El Taher described the situation in the camp as ""dire"", because the rains damage houses and schools, and the accumulated water blocks the streets. He demanded the aid organisations in the camp to offer help to the vulnerable people in Kalma, and provide them with plastic sheets, rugs and bed nets.  On Thursday, Radio Dabanga reported that many of the more than 163,000 displaced people in Kalma camp suffer from a shortage of food and poor sanitary provisions.

277,556,disaster,"Trash-choked waterways and development in low-lying areas is combining with more extreme rainfall to drive flooding  PARAMARIBO, Suriname (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Trash-clogged drainage canals, growing development in low-lying areas and increasingly extreme weather are adding up to worsening flooding in Suriname.  Last month, Suriname was lashed by heavy rains – nearly double the usual rainfall for the period - that led to evacuations and crop and livestock losses as floodwater rapidly overflowed the country’s waterways.  Officials blamed the crisis in part on failure to prepare for the growing risks.  “We’re noticing that the weather patterns are changing and we ratify all those climate change resolutions, but do we really follow through? As long as we don’t, we’ll be mopping up while the water is running,” said Patrick Kensenhuis, a member of parliament for hard-hit Para district.  In Paramaribo, the capital, several residential areas were flooded. In Saramacca district in the west, poultry and vegetable farmers faced heavy losses when the Saramacca River and other waterways proved unable to handle the overflow.  One distraught farmer told the media that he had only been able to save a few of his chickens when the rainwater reached a height of 30 cm (12 inches) inside his coops. “It happened so fast,” he said. Other farmers reported losing all their crops to the floods.  The last time such bad weather hit the country was in June 2006, when more than 450 mm of rain caused rivers in the hinterlands to burst their banks, flooding around 100 villages, killing three people and forcing hundreds to be relocated. This year there were no deaths.  In Para district, which is usually dry, some cassava farmers have lost their entire year’s harvest. Kensenhuis, an area member of parliament, said the weather was a blow to an ongoing effort to establish a cassava meal industry in the district. Cassava is widely considered a climate-resilient crop.  “There are about 70 farmers here who took part in this programme and sowed an average of 3 hectares (about 7 acres),” Kensenhuis said. “They invested thousands of their own money in hopes of making profits.”  He said that 20 of the farmers had lost all their crop, and estimated that the rains may have cost some of them in excess of 50,000 Surinamese dollars (about US $15,000). Some cattle farmers, meanwhile, have suffered losses close to 500,000 dollars ($153,000).  Some 300 people from five communities in Marowijne district, in the east of the country, were relocated when the Cottica River overflowed, reaching up to one metre in depth in their villages.  “All we can do is express solidarity and look for ways to prevent this from happening again in the future,” said Marinus Bee, a member of parliament who led a parliamentary delegation to the area along with President Desi Bouterse.  GARBAGE PROBLEM  But Para District Commissioner Jerry Miranda wrote to the president suggesting that the state get tougher on people who dump garbage.  “We need to get Suriname cleaner. The problem is indeed that we get excessive rains, but the true culprit is the garbage that is dumped on the roadsides and in our canals,” Miranda said in an interview.  “Ironically it’s those same environmental barbarians who dump the garbage who complain later when they’re flooded,” he said. He called for steep fines for anyone caught dumping garbage.  Kensenhuis agreed that dumping is a problem. “Many important canals are indeed clogged. I know the Ministry of Public Works is paying contractors to maintain the canals, but if that work had been done and monitored properly, why are we having this problem with flooding now?” he asked.  He said residents of the affected areas needed better education about steps they could take to mitigate their risks from extreme weather.  According to Sieuwnath Naipal, a hydrologist at the University of Suriname, cleaning and maintaining canals will not by itself solve the problem of flooding.  “This is not one problem, but a combination of many,” which vary by area, Naipal stated in an e-mail.  He noted that the traditional practice of building on higher ground and leaving lower-lying areas for agriculture has changed as the country’s population (currently just over half a million) has grown. Infrastructure and residential developments have moved to coastal areas, and newer canals have smaller gradients, slowing the flow of water.  “Our coastal areas are very fertile, so weeds in the canals grow fast and irrigation is hampered. On top of that there is little to no control on the canals, which are a dumping ground for plastic bottles and other refuse,” Naipal said.  He agreed that the problem is worse because rains have intensified as a result of climate change, including rising seas along Suriname’s coastline.  “Because of the rise of the sea level our rivers are not able to fully handle the overflow that comes from the canals,” he said. Another problem is that “we still continue to parcel out (land) in the coastal areas that used to be under water.”  “Under these circumstances it will be impossible to hold off this problem that returns every year,” Naipal said.

Devastating floods in 2011 killed more than 800 people and caused massive disruption to industry, cutting economic growth that year to just 0.1 percent.  Four people have been killed in this year's flooding. More rainfall is expected later this week.  ""Due to a heavier-than-usual monsoon season, 21 provinces are now experiencing flooding.

Ghana  At least 90 people have been killed in a fuel station explosion in Accra, said to have been caused after flood waters swept stored gasoline into a nearby fire. Hundreds of people in Accra have been forced from their homes by the flooding, which has also affected power supplies.  Ghana’s Communications Ministry said in a statement: “Many suburbs of Accra and surrounding parts have been heavily affected, leading to heavy restriction of movement of people. The general public is kindly advised to avoid fast-moving rainwater and areas they know have big drains. Stay on higher ground, where necessary, to prevent loss of life.”  Axim, South Ghana, which lies about 300 km east of Accra saw 88 mm of rain fall in 24 hours to 03 June 2015.  Togo  In Togo, heavy rain from 02 June 2015 has caused flooding in southern parts of the country. Worst affected is the city of Lome, where one person has been killed and several injured after homes were damaged, ECHO report. Local media say that around 5,000 people have been displaced by the floods. Tabligbo in southern Togo saw 73 mm of rain fall in 24 hours.  Benin  In Benin, 84 mm of rain fell in Cotonou in 24 hours to 03 June 2015. Local media say that flooding has damaged several homes and blocked streets in the largest city and economic centre of Benin.  Just last week the World Bank approved a new US$40 million International Development Association (IDA) credit for Benin to improve its infrastructure and minimize the negative impacts of the 2010 floods as well as increase the level of preparedness for any future flooding.  In 2010 the heavy rains in Benin created unexpected rising water levels that overwhelmed the country’s traditional preventive response and resilience mechanisms. As a results 278 schools were flooded and more than 50,000 houses were destroyed leaving 150,000 people without shelter. The 2010 floods ruined 128,000 hectares of crops and farmland and an estimated 12,000 metric tons of food stocks were lost because of destroyed storage facilities.  A Drainage Master Plan and a Solid Waste Management (SWM) Strategy was prepared under the original project in 2014. It revealed significant clogging in numerous points in the drainage system, which, if not treated, could bring about further flooding.  “An additional 94,000 people will no longer be subjected to periodic flooding with today’s new financing that will build on the original project and help improve and expand access to reliable drainage systems in poor areas of Benin,” says Ousmane Diagana, the World Bank’s Country Director for Benin.",http://floodlist.com/africa/deadly-floods-west-africa-togo-benin-ghana,en

Thirty out of the 200 houses have been completed and families started moving into their new two-room, cyclone-resistant homes in October 2014.  Under the Cyclone Ian Reconstruction and Climate Resilience Project, a joint World Bank and Tonga government initiative, up to 350 one-room houses are also set to be constructed with building contracts awarded to two local companies in December 2014. Damaged houses will be repaired and existing houses will be reinforced to withstand future cyclones.  Swift action to assist Tonga  The Category 5 cyclone was the most powerful storm ever recorded in Tonga and had devastating impacts on the Ha’apai island group. An estimated 5,500 people, approximately 70% of the Ha’apai population, were affected. Most of the 1,100 houses and many of the public facilities were damaged or destroyed. Fourteen people were injured and one person died.  Within two weeks of the cyclone, the government received $1.27 million from the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance pilot program, which the country joined in 2013. The pilot program provides participating Pacific Island countries with risk insurance from natural disasters such as cyclones, tsunamis, and earthquakes.  This payment was the first received by any country under the pilot and allowed swift action for on-the-ground support for the Ha’apai people.  “A week after the cyclone, the World Bank team along with the government visited Ha’apai,” said Havea Tu’iha’angana, Governor of Ha’apai. “They started by carrying out surveys and collecting data on damaged houses. I am very thankful for this project because it’s very quick.”  Another $12 million in grants and low interest loans were provided through the World Bank’s Crisis Response Window (CRW). The funds were received within four months of Cyclone Ian, making it the fastest ever payout through the CRW. This was complemented by $2 million in funds from the government. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery provided a grant of $ 1.8 million to help Tonga prepare for future disasters.",http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/12/17/tonga-survivors-get-back-on-their-feet-after-tropical-cyclone-ian,en

The qualitative survey was conducted in five provinces, while the quantitative survey was based on a national random sample of around 6000 households. The household and individual interviews were conducted with those who returned to their village and those who remained in displacement. The quantitative survey questionnaire was prepared using the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and interviewees were selected through a random number table, also known as the ‘Kish’ method.  IDPs fled their homes due to armed conflict between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). More than 30 percent of the persons displaced by violence fled their homes between 1986 and 1990, 60 percent between 1991 and 1995, and the remainder between 1996 and 2005 (Haceteppe University, 2006). The vast majority of displacement movements occurred in the south-east of the country from rural areas to urban centres, where security forces battled Kurdish militias.

302,607,conflict,"Lucky David Wilson (in red) filming his music video with Achan Katherine in Unyama trading centre, a former IDP camp in northern Uganda. © UNHCR/S.Perham  GULU, Uganda, January 6 (UNHCR) - Lucky David Wilson was born in a war zone in troubled times, but somehow manages to live up to his name.  As a boy, he fled attacks on his village of Guru Guru when northern Uganda became the frontline in the battle between the Ugandan army and the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. Now 19, he has become a popular singer who uses music to advocate for peace and reconstruction in his homeland.  Wilson is a symbol of the new north, where relative peace has returned since the signing of a cease-fire agreement in 2006.  UNHCR opened an office the same year in the northern town of Gulu to manage 251 camps and provide protection to an estimated 1.84 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in 11 districts. Since then, more than 1.8 million have returned home on their own. To ensure sustainable returns, the UN refugee agency worked with the local authorities to provide basic services in home villages. This involved building community access roads, police posts, schools, health centres and clean water sources and putting in place a public administration infrastructure.  UNHCR also engaged agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, USAID, Care, World Vision and the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II for longer-term development in areas of return.  ""This is a happy day for all,"" said UNHCR Representative in Uganda, Kai Nielsen, as he closed the Gulu office last week. ""Together with the government and aid agencies, we've managed to find solutions to one of the world's biggest IDP crises and help hundreds of thousands of Ugandans to go home.""  While most of the IDPs made their own way home, some needed extra support. UNHCR and partners helped 11,600 of the most vulnerable IDPs and returnees by ensuring legal access to land and engaging the community to build huts and latrines. They were also given a start-up kit with blankets, jerry cans, sleeping mats, and kitchen sets, as well as an income safety net with livestock, seeds and tools.  Achan Katherine is one of the beneficiaries. Physically disabled and facing mobility problems, she has chosen to stay at the Unyama trading centre, a former IDP camp. UNHCR worked with the National Union for Disabled Persons in Uganda (NUDIPU) to assess the needs of people like her, and recently distributed wheelchairs to disabled people in Gulu district together with the Association for Volunteers in International Service (AVSI).  Wheelchairs, tricycles, white canes and crutches were designed and built locally by the Gulu Youth Development Association to create jobs, develop skills among the youth and to make the devices available to the greater community.  Katherine, who had been moving on her hands for years, was delighted with her new wheelchair. ""Now I can move around my compound on my own and visit friends,"" she said in her native Acholi-Luo tongue. ""Agencies need to continue this kind of help.""  She was doubly excited when Lucky David turned up for the distribution and asked her to appear in the music video for his new hit song Roco Gang (Rebuilding Home). Her relatives and neighbours danced around her as he sang his song encouraging youth to support the vulnerable and elderly within their own communities.  ""In our culture, when you do things like helping those who are disabled or having problems, the whole community is appreciative,"" said Lucky David, who is now based in Gulu town. ""I'm so happy to be given the chance to spread these messages.""  Today, some 30,000 Ugandans remain displaced in northern Uganda, living in four remaining camps, as well as former camps-turned-trading centres and transit sites. More than 6,000 have settled locally. Their need for assistance and protection has diminished as the communities work with aid agencies and the local government to develop and stabilize the region.

304,609,disaster,"St Jude, dubbed the Great Storm of 2013, caused devastation as it swept across Britain Sunday night, with two people crushed to death by falling trees, another killed in a gas explosion and a boy missing after being swept out to sea.  Hundreds of thousands of homes have been left without power and rush-hour commuters suffered transport chaos as hurricane-force conditions battered Britain.  David Cameron called the injuries and deaths ""hugely regrettable"" but praised the preparation and response of emergency services.  People watch the waves batter into the sea wall of a marina in Brighton, south England  On a visit to the Mini plant, the Prime Minister told reporters: ""The emergency services, as ever, do a brilliant job. These are difficult things to handle because you don't know for certain how strong the storm will be.  ""That really is the advice to people: things will get back to normal but make sure you consult the relevant websites before you travel.""  A man in his 50s was killed when a tree fell on the car he was driving in Watford, at around 6.50am, Hertfordshire Police said. Officers closed the road to deal with the incident but the man, from Harrow in north west London, was pronounced dead at the scene.  Meanwhile, a 17-year-old girl was killed in Hever, Kent, when a tree blew on to the caravan where she was sleeping at 7.18am. The teenager, named by sources as Bethany ""Gia"" Freeman, was crushed as the 30ft tree fell down in Lydens Lane, Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, at 7.18am.  Bethany and her family were living in the caravans while renovation work was taking place at their home, according to two neighbours.  One of them, who declined to be named, said: ""(The family) were planning to join up their two buildings, and they were living in the caravans in order to do it.  ""I don't know who else was there. At the end of the day the tree has come down. I won't criticise anyone working there but not one of the emergency services had a chainsaw.  ""It came down to the locals having chainsaws in order to cut a gap and also the local farmer having lifting gear.""  The storm's third and fourth victims were found at an address in Hounslow, west London, which was devastated after a falling tree led to a suspected gas explosion this morning.  Five people and three dogs escaped from the properties before firefighters arrived and a man and two women were taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service. Two bodies were found by urban search and rescue crews, who searched the properties for any survivors.  Station Manager Matt Burrows, who was at the scene shortly after the incident, said: “Three houses were completely destroyed in the blast, debris was scattered over an area of about 50 metres, and the roof of one of the houses was in a tree across the road. Highly trained search and rescue crews searched through the rubble with sniffer dogs, and sadly two people were found dead.  “We’re still investigating whether the fallen tree caused the gas explosion or whether the gas explosion caused the tree to fall. It’s likely firefighters will be on scene for much of the rest of the day.”  A 14-year-old boy feared dead after being swept into the sea in rough weather has been named by sources as Dylan Alkins. The teenager disappeared while playing in the surf at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, at about 4.15pm on Sunday.  Rescue teams, including a Coastguard helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat, scoured the area in what were described as ""atrocious conditions"" with poor visibility.  An MCA spokeswoman said rescue teams had struggled in difficult conditions, and that police were with the boy's family who were ""distraught"".  Several other people have been injured by falling debris. London Ambulance said a man in his 40s was taken to hospital with a shoulder injury after a tree fell on his motorbike in south-west London.  Up to 220,000 homes suffered power cuts as St Jude's storm with winds of almost 100mph pushed across the South West, South, South East, the Midlands and the East of England, UK Power Networks said.

There were no trains at all running on London Overground, while there were part -suspensions on the Central, District, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines.  Asked if the train companies had overreacted to the risk posed by the storm, the Prime Minister said it was important that decisions were based on the evidence.  He said: ""Everyone has to act on the basis of the evidence that they are given.""  But he added: ""Obviously afterwards we will be able to look back and see whether people made the right decisions.  ""But right now what matters is listening to the evidence, working together and getting things back to normal.""

Environment Secretary Liz Truss said there had been a ""number of weather-related fatalities"" and the severity of the weather was ""unprecedented"". While the Met Office's chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo said the extreme weather conditions were ""extraordinary"". She told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""Is it to do with climate change?

The link to global warming could increase pressure on the UK to make sure that a strong deal gets agreed in at the ongoing climate change summit in Paris. The Environment Agency has said that more than 5,200 homes and businesses have been flooded, with David Cameron visiting the worst-hit areas. The Deputy First Minister has pledged that Scottish councils will recieve government cash if they can show the flooding caused by Storm Desmond has caused a burden that could not have been accomodated in their local budgets.

In total, hundreds of flood alerts and warnings have been issued - more than 30 of them severe.  Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""My thoughts are with people whose homes have been flooded.  ""I'll chair a COBRA [emergency committee] call [on Sunday] to ensure everything is being done to help.""  In pictures: North of England flooding  The River Irwell and River Roch have both overflowed, causing flooding in Salford, Manchester city centre and Rochdale.  Roads in central Leeds, where a severe warning is in place on the River Aire, are also under water.  Rest centres  Red Cross volunteers are working in three rest centres in Chorley, Salford and Bury. A spokeswoman said there were more than 50 people at the centre in Bury.  In York, people in the most-at-risk properties near the River Foss, a tributary of the River Ouse, have been advised by the Environment Agency to move valuable belongings upstairs and to prepare to be evacuated.

Ribchester resident Alan Tomlinson told the BBC the situation was ""pretty grim"" with many homes at risk of flooding.  ""The village is under siege really,"" he said.  ""The routes to the south are cut off and the route to the north, to Longridge, is under threat.""  Kellie Hughes, a hairdresser who lives in Whalley, said the situation was ""a million times worse"" than a fortnight ago when floods also hit.  She said: ""It's just horrific, really bad.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, who announced a review of flood defences earlier this month, said the priority ""continues to be protecting lives, protecting homes and protecting businesses"".  Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Guy Shrubsole said the record rainfall and repeated flooding in December were a sign of changing climate and highlighted the need for greater action by the government.  Local Government Association environment spokesman Peter Box said councils were ""pulling out all the stops"" to find accommodation for those forced to leave their homes amid flooding.  ""Storms in Cumbria and Lancashire have reminded us just how unforgiving and formidable nature can be but councils in the regions have worked hard to try and minimise the impact on residents,"" he added.

David McNew/Reuters  The fire burns near the residential community of Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley, 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered as unseasonably warm weather, dry conditions and the infamous Santa Ana winds have combined to spread the flames.  The fire burns near the residential community of Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley, just 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.  The fire burns near the residential community of Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley, just 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.  The Colby fire continues to burn outside the communities of Glendora and Azusa, about 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, but officials announced Thursday evening that the fire’s forward spread had stopped. Some evacuation orders remain in effect as firefighters hope to take advantage of calmer winds Friday.  The fire caught sometime before dawn Thursday morning and had burned 1,709 acres by Thursday night, consuming five residences as well as other structures. The fire is named for a trail where it is believed to have started.  Three men were arrested in connection with the fire Thursday. Glendora police accused them of starting a campfire that quickly spread out of control, according to the Los Angeles Times.  About 3,600 people were evacuated Thursday, but about half of them have been allowed to return to their homes. The perimeter of the fire is 30 percent contained, according to data from the Forest Service. Several hundred firefighters are working to contain the flames.  The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning through this evening for the Sierra Nevada and the coast of Southern California as far as the Mexican border, indicating a high risk of fire. The service cited unseasonably warm and dry weather at the end of an unusually arid year that has desiccated fuels in the state’s wildlands.  Humidity could fall as low as 3 percent in Los Angeles on Friday, and forecasters anticipate gusts of 40 mph in the valleys. The temperature is expected to reach 84 degrees.

308,630,disaster,"Areas around the state lines of South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota, as well as parts of Nebraska, have seen massive amounts of rainfall over the last few days, causing severe flooding. A state of emergency has been declared in South Dakota and in Iowa. Around 400 people have been evacuated in northwest Iowa. Homes and property have been damaged and some roads, including the Interstate 29, have been closed. The area has also been hit by storms, strong wind and hail.  Storms and Tornadoes  The heavy rainfall and storms are part of a weather system that earlier this week brought tornadoes to Pilger in Nebraska, where one person died and 19 were injured people. The town itself sustained extensive damage, with a reportedly 50-70% of buildings and infrastructure damaged or destroyed. The storms and torrential rainfall of Monday and Tuesday were followed by a tornado warnings for parts of South Dakota late Tuesday 17 June 2014. Initial reports claim homes have been destroyed by a tornado in the small town of Humboldt in Minnehaha County, South Dakota.  South Dakota State of Emergency  Flooding has been severe in some areas, in particular Sioux Fall, South Dakota, where Governor Dennis Daugaard declared a state of emergency on Tuesday 17 June 2014.  Canton, south Dakota, was also badly hit by flooding. In fact flooding was so bad, the Interstate 29 near the Canton exit had to be closed during the evening of16 June 2014. Flood water was so high it reached the headlights of cars trapped on the highway. Interstate 29 re-opened early the next day.  For some time during Monday and Tuesday, the small city of Canton was cut off from the outside world by flood water. The flooding spread across the area, affecting Harrisburg, South Dakota, and the wider areas of Lincoln and Turner counties.  Rainfall Totals 24 Hours 16 to 17 June 2014  Minnesota  Lakefield Mines- 3.29 inches  Iowa  Peterson – 5.14 inches  Sibley – 4.10  Orange City – 3.49  Sioux City Airport – 3.12  South Dakota  Sioux Falls – 3.00 inches  Centerville – 2.95  Rainfall amounts. Image from National weather service  (figures and image from National Weather Service)  June Rainfall Records  So far Sioux Falls has seen 9.97 inches of rain fall in June this year, which beats the previous record of 8.43 inches set in 1984 and we still have 12 more days until the end of the month.  Evacuations and State of Emergency in Iowa  Flooding was also seen in southern Minnesota and northwest Iowa. Around 350 people had to evacuate their homes in Alvord, Lyon County on Monday 16 June.  Some of the worst affected areas of Iowa were those along the Rock River, where high levels are threatening some communities in the area, particularly in Rock Rapids and Rock Valley.  RT @ArgusMWalker: Just one of the areas flooded in Rock Valley. pic.twitter.com/GBN8M8TXZW — ArgusLeader911 (@Argus911) June 17, 2014  On Monday the Rock River levels stood at more than 24 feet. The highest level on record stands at 28 feet from 1993. Around 70 people had to evacuate their homes in Rock Valley on Monday 16 June. The Red Cross has set up temporary accommodation for the displaced and a state of emergency has been declared.  There have also been some reports that a levee in Rock valley broke, leaving the town facing further flooding. Thousands of volunteers were placing sandbags and emergency flood defences to help protect homes and property in the area.

309,631,disaster,"Event Narrative  A tornado formed along a squall line west of Platteville, just south of County Road B, and traveled through Memorial Park on to the Univ. of Wisconsin - Platteville campus. Five people were injured, one of them seriously. There was extensive damage done to five buildings and the stadium on campus. Roofs of two new residential halls were partially destroyed and a third residential hall was also damaged along with one academic building. Two large lighting structures at the football stadium were knocked over, with one crashing across the bleachers causing the concrete foundation underneath the bleachers to be substantially moved. Damage continued into nearby homes and businesses as the tornado tracked across Business Highway 151. The top level of a split level home was ripped off one house, another house lost part of a roof and a porch while several other homes had windows blown out and trees knocked down. A gas station/convenience store was leveled by the tornado where it also ripped a pump out of the ground and blew over a semi. Numerous other business and vehicles suffered blown out windows. After hitting a cemetery on the south side of town, the tornado dissipated just before reaching U.S. Highway 151 southeast of town. A total of 12 homes were destroyed with another 20 damaged.  At UW-Platteville, the tornado caused $7.3 million in damage to Bridgeway Commons, $4.8 million in damage to Rountree Commons and $1.8 million to Southwest Hall. All three buildings are dorms.  The tornado caused $1.8 million in damage to Engineering Hall, a classroom building, and $1.7 million in damage to the stadium.",http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=518334,en
310,632,disaster,"Another Month, Another Couple of Towns Wiped Out by Tornadoes  By John Lawrence  June 2014 was one of the worst months on record for extreme weather. Tuesday June 3 saw baseball size hail, 100 mph wind gusts and 11 tornadoes in South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. In Omaha and Des Moines there were hundreds of reports of hail. Trees toppled on autos. Wind damage was mostly from derecchio winds. Derecchio winds are straight line winds which can be as damaging as tornadoes.  In Blair, Nebraska, officials said nearly every home, as well as any car that was parked outdoors, was damaged. The courthouse alone sustained more than $1.2 million in damage because, after hail shattered windows and skylights, rain penetrated inside. The insurance price tag in Nebraska and western Iowa will soar into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Although a handful of tornadoes were reported, baseball-sized hail and flooding rains left the biggest mark.  Blair resident, Donna Jones, said she saw widespread damage when she went to work Wednesday morning. “Everybody is in a daze,” Jones said. “There’s not a house that isn’t touched.” The Woodhouse Auto Family, which owns car dealerships in both Iowa and Nebraska, said on Facebook that about 4,500 vehicles were damaged across their properties. Hoods were dented and windshields were shattered. Company officials Wednesday estimated damages at $162 million. Hail smashed house windows and damaged siding. Police in Blair said 20 people were taken to the hospital with injuries. In several other cities, streets were flooded and trees were knocked down. Power was out.  By Thursday June 5th power outages remained across portions of Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee following strong winds associated with the storms Wednesday night and Thursday morning. More than 6.8 inches of rain fell in two hours early Thursday morning at Centerville, Tennessee, as a flash flood warning was posted for the area.  Omaha, Nebraska, had its wettest June day in history on Tuesday, breaking a 139-year-old record with 5.30 inches of rain and single-handedly wiping out its rainfall deficit for 2014.  By Thursday roof damage was reported in Lindsborg, Kansas, where 90-mph winds were estimated behind an area of decaying thunderstorms. Baseball-size hail was reported in at least two locations in Kansas. The storms then tore across the Ozarks before reintensifying over northeast Arkansas, where at least one building was destroyed by straight-line derecchio winds.  On June 16 tornadoes in Nebraska killed at least one person. 16 others were taken to hospital in critrical condition. At least 2 tornadoes touched down, one a mile wide.  Also on that day there were wildfires near Bakersfield, CA. Gusty winds were not helping. Three and a half square miles burned. Five hundred homes were evacuated.  The Tiny Town Too Tough to Die  On June 18 twin tornadoes ripped through Pilger, Nebraska.There were two EF-4 tornadoes with 200 mph wind speeds. The total devastation belied the town’s motto, “The tiny town too tough to die.” The rare twin tornadoes wiped out the town’s business district, obliterated its fire station and ground 40 or 50 homes into rubble, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger said. The City Hall, Public Library, Fire Department and Midwest Bank were gone. As much as three quarters of the town of 350 is gone. Two people died during the storm including a five year old girl.  On the same day that Pilger was destroyed, a tornado damaged more than 40 houses and dozens of businesses in Wessington Springs, South Dakota. The same system that brought devastating tornadoes to Pilger, Nebraska and Wessington Springs, South Dakota doused parts of South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Illinois leading to historic flooding in some areas. After a week of heavy rains and rising waters, the floods that have developed in the Midwest had become deadly.  Also on June 18 California banned open burning on 31 million acres. There have been more than 2000 wildfires this year in California, 70% more than average. At the same time temperatures around 100 degrees F were recorded in Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Fire on a Navajo reservation burned 19 square miles on the Arizona and New Mexico border.  In Minnesota a state of emergency was declared in 35 counties on June 19 after days of heavy rain led to widespread flooding. Minneapolis set a record for the wettest June since record keeping began 140 years ago. Homes in over half the counties in the state of Minnesota have been impacted by flooding. In just 8 hours 6 inchs of rain fell in the St Paul/Minneapolis area. More than 25 inches of rain have fallen so far this June in the twin cities area. In Saint Paul the Mississippi River is at 20 feet – 6 feet above flood stage. Rivers will be at flood stage till after the 4th of July and beyond if rain continues to fall. Farm losses in Minnesota are at $7 Million so far. Mudslides threatened a hospital in Saint Paul.  Farm fields are under water, roads have been washed out, dams have failed and water has infiltrated homes from the far north to the far south of Minnesota. Four state parks have been fully or partially closed because of high water. “The damage is really unprecedented and very widespread,” Gov. Mark Dayton said before boarding a plane to southern Minnesota along with U.S. Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar.  Damage assessments already total in the millions even before surveying can start in many places soaked by downpours over the past week. Some lakes and rivers swelled to record levels, with others not expected to crest for days, if not weeks.  Record Rainfall, Record Floods, States of Emergency Declared  Gov. Daugaard declared a state of emergency for South Dakota on Tuesday. Daugaard also ordered the opening of the State Emergency Operations Center to monitor the effects of the torrential rains and coordinate the state’s response. The Red Cross also opened an emergency shelter to help people who have been evacuated or can’t reach their homes because of the flooding.  Sioux Falls, South Dakota obliterated its previous wettest month on record, 9.42 inches in May 1898, taking only half the month to do it. Through June 21, 13.39 inches of rain had soaked Sioux Falls, which is over half the average yearly precipitation of 26.38 inches. Sioux City, Iowa, broke its wettest month on record Friday, and by Sunday, Sioux City’s total had reached 13.25 inches, well above the old single-month record of 11.78 inches in May 1903.  Along the South Dakota-Iowa border, the town of Canton, South Dakota, was hit hard by flooding earlier in the week, and many homes were destroyed.  “I have nothing left. It’s all gone,” said Canton resident Dale Larson.  Within a 24-hour time span between Monday morning and Tuesday morning (June 22), 8.43 inches of rain was measured in Canton, about 20 miles southeast of Sioux Falls. According to the National Weather Service, this was the third highest 24-hour precipitation total in state history, narrowly missing the all-time record of 8.74 inches on May 6, 2007 in Groton.  The flooding stretched over the border into western Iowa, where Rock Rapids and Rock Valley have been partially evacuated. In Rock Rapids, about 60 homes have had water waist deep or higher, Mayor Jason Chase said, and many have shifted from their foundations or have damaged basement walls.  “This is the worst I’ve seen and I’ve been here since 1997,” he said. Several families remain in a Red Cross shelter, Chase said.  Gov. Terry Branstad and Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Department Director Mark Schouten surveyed damage in Rock Rapids and Rock Valley on Wednesday.  Rock Valley, about 20 miles southwest of Rock Rapids, requested pumps and sandbagging materials from the state after a levee broke on Tuesday night. The river is receding, but a local shelter still is available for residents needing to leave their homes.  The Big Sioux River set record flood levels at Hawarden and Akron where it peaked Tuesday. A levee also was breached in Akron, causing several residents to be evacuated late Tuesday night and early Wednesday. The city pumped out floodwaters to protect City Hall and other buildings.  Downstream, the Omaha Public Power District said it will reduce power as it prepares for rising water on the Missouri River. The district’s Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant sits about 20 miles north of Omaha, and was surrounded by water during flooding three years ago.  In southern Wisconsin, a line of thunderstorms that spawned twisters rolled through late Monday and early Tuesday. The town of Madison was hit hard. Mayor Paul Soglin said about 25 homes were damaged by the storm, which caused about $10 million in damages.  The National Weather Service said it appeared a tornado touched down and lifted several times in the Mineral Point and Verona areas. At least 19 homes in Verona, near Madison, were damaged so badly they were uninhabitable. The weather service said two tornadoes touched down in Plateville.  Some parts of the Midwest — including parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Nebraska — received 5 to 10 inches of rain over the course of a week, an amount that’s the equivalent of two months of rainfall in the region. In Minnesota, the rain caused mudslides and forced evacuations.  “Right now what we’re seeing is a statewide disaster, really,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said Sunday. “From International Falls on the Canadian border down to Luverne on the Iowa border, it really covered the whole state.”  The rain has damaged corn and soybean crops, according to local reports, with water slow to drain from farmers’ fields. If farmers can get the water off their crops over the next few days, the crops could survive, and soybeans can be replanted this late in the season. The rains also elevated river levels, which could temporarily halt grain shipments in the region.  As rains soak the Midwest, California is parched, with 100 percent of the state in the most severe stages of drought. California Gov. Jerry Brown linked the state’s epic drought and ramped-up wildfire season to climate change last month, saying that the severe weather patterns prove that “humanity is on a collision course with nature.”  Science has shown that climate change will exacerbate — and likely already is exacerbating — heavy rainfall and drought conditions throughout the U.S. These events are sometimes sequential: long periods of drought can be followed by torrential downpours, making it difficult for the parched soil to absorb the rain and leading to flooding.  As the month ended, the midwest was continuing to experience more torrential rain, flooding, damaging winds, tornadoes and hail. The worst was not over.",http://sandiegofreepress.org/2014/06/extreme-weather-watch-june-2014-torrential-rains-baseball-sized-hail-massive-midwest-flooding-2/,en
311,635,disaster,"When the smoke cleared from a new wildfire threatening the small Columbia River Gorge community of Rowena, area residents glimpsed an even less-welcome sight – a line of flames visible from the city of the Dalles, about six miles away.  After the fire made a run along the river Wednesday evening, residents of 275 homes in Rowena were told to evacuate, fire spokesman Dave Wells said.  Residents of nearly 90 homes in an outlying subdivision of the Dalles, a city of about 14,000, were told to be ready to leave if necessary, Wells said.  Firefighters planned to work through the night protecting structures.  No homes had burned as of Wednesday night, the spokesman said.  Five helicopters dropped water on the blaze Wednesday as winds gusted to more than 30mph, fire spokesman Justin de Ruyter said.  A section of US Highway 30 was closed in the area, but Interstate 84 remained open. Rowena is about 75 miles east of Portland.  The fire began in brush Tuesday night and quickly spread to about 200 acres of timber and scrub oak in rocky, steep terrain that is home to rattlesnakes, ticks and poison oak.  “We’ve got a challenging fire on our hands,” de Ruyter said.  Governor John Kitzhaber invoked the state’s authority to mobilize local fire departments to protect buildings, and structural protection fire crews have come from three counties.  The governor also toured Oregon’s biggest wildfire, the Oregon Gulch fire, which burned six homes last week in the Siskiyou Mountains along the California border about 15 miles east of Ashland. It was 37% contained at 57 sq miles. While in fire camp, he called on Congress to pay for more forest-thinning projects to reduce the risk of wildfires.  “These fires are a symptom of a much larger forest health issue,” he said. “We just have to begin to deal with the root causes. That means lending some urgency to improving the health and resiliency of our forests in a way that can produce jobs.”  US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this week said the US Forest Service will soon have to start pulling funding from thinning projects and other programs to pay for the continued battle against wildfires.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters try to stop the spreading of the Eiler Fire from moving closer to Burney, California. Photograph: Andreas Fuhrmann/AP  In all, there are 10 large fires in Oregon, with nearly 4,000 people fighting them across 143 sq miles of timber and rangeland. The cost to date exceeds $36.7m.  The north-west has been at fire preparedness level five – the top level – since 16 July, and the season still has a long way to go, said Tom Knappenberger, a spokesman at the federal interagency fire center in Portland.  • In Washington, fire spokesmen say a wildfire burning on the Colville Indian Reservation in the northeastern part of the state has scorched about 7,000 acres.  Residents of about 25 homes have been told to evacuate in the face of the Devil’s Elbow Complex of three wildfires. Detected Sunday, those fires were likely ignited by lightning.  Fire spokeswoman Karen Ripley said late Wednesday that no homes have burned. About 210 firefighters are attacking the flames.  The Snag Canyon wildfire near Ellensburg in central Washington has grown to 6,400 acres and is being fought by about 450 firefighters.  The Washington incident management team reports that fire was started by lightning on Saturday and is burning through grass, brush and timber about 12 miles north-west of Ellensburg. The fire has destroyed eight homes.  • In California, light rain and an infusion of personnel and equipment from as far away as San Diego allowed fire crews to continue gaining momentum Wednesday on a pair of wildfires that exploded over the weekend in northern California and have burned more than 110 square miles, officials said. The two fires burning about seven miles apart in Shasta and Lassen counties were among nine major wildfires that erupted in a 24-hour period last week, most sparked by lightning.  Eight homes, a historic post office and a restaurant were lost in the smaller of the two fires that started in Lassen National Forest and threatened Burney, a town of about 3,000 people in Shasta County. An evacuation advisory for Burney was lifted on Tuesday.  The spread of the second blaze had also slowed enough that people living in its path were allowed to return home on Tuesday afternoon.",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/oregon-wildfire-evacuations-california-washington-forest-burn,en

314,640,disaster,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A powerful earthquake rattled through Northern California early Sunday morning, leaving dozens wounded and thousands without power. It is the strongest temblor to hit the Napa Valley area in nearly 25 years. VPC  A man uses a garden hose cool hot spots from a fire at a mobile home park following a 6.0 earthquake on Aug. 24, 2014 in Napa, Calif. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images)    NAPA, Calif. — A strong earthquake that rocked Northern California's scenic Napa wine country early Sunday injured more than 100 people, sent brick and concrete tumbling from historic buildings and triggered fires and power outages.  Officials said at least 15 buildings were left uninhabitable, and many more awaited further evaluation. State transportation officials inspected highways and bridges and declared them safe for travel.  The magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck around 3:20 a.m.. For some residents, the temblor revived memories of the last big quake to strike the San Francisco Bay Area 25 years ago, which did major damage.  Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties. Schools in Napa Valley were ordered closed Monday.  Mike Parness, city manager, said 15 or 16 buildings in the central downtown were ""red tagged"" after inspectors found damage left them too dangerous for people to enter. Several dozen other buildings were awaiting further evaluation.  ""We've got a lot of workers out checking out homes and buildings,'' Parness said.  In the city's downtown section, a 10-foot chunk of brick and concrete was shaken from the corner of the old county courthouse building. Big pieces of rubble littered the lawn and street in front of the building.  Largest Napa quake since Loma Prieta  The quake was centered near American Canyon about 6 miles southwest of Napa, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It's the largest quake to hit the Napa Valley region near San Francisco since the Loma Prieta temblor in 1989.  At least three people were reported in critical condition following quake injuries, officials said. One of them, a 13-year-old boy injured by a falling fireplace, was airlifted to the University of California-Davis hospital for surgery.  Jack LaRochelle, public works director of the city of about 77,000 people, said 30 water mains were broken and requiring repairs.  After the initial shock wore off, an almost festive air prevailed in the city with tourists on rented bicycles riding through closed streets. At one point so many people were sending photos from their mobile phones that cellular systems were overwhelmed.  Most of the heavily damaged buildings were in the older, central area of town. Newer homes and buildings away from the center of city city suffered less damage, but many were without power, officials said.    That lack of power meant some residents who rely on well water were unable to get water.  John Furtado headed into Napa to look for water. ""But we're doing fine overall. It's just some minor damage. A couple bottles of wine broke,'' he said.  Many injured during clean-up  Kelly Huston, a deputy director with the California Office of Emergency Services, said there were no reports of fatalities, but dozens were taken to local hospitals. Most injuries, he anticipated, would be from falling objects and debris.    Napa's local hospital, Queen of the Valley Medical Center, treated 172 patients Sunday and admitted 13, CEO Walt Mickens said. Most were treated for cuts and bruises, while at least three were admitted for broken bones and two for heart attacks.  ""Now it appears we're treating people (injured while) cleaning up,"" hospital spokeswoman Vanessa deGier said Sunday afternoon.  CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As Napa, California business owners look over the damage, they say this is worse than the 1989 earthquake that hit the area. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit the Napa Valley early Sunday morning.  Huston said several fires were burning in the area of the quake and that the state was dispatching urban search and rescue teams ""much like we would on a wildfire."" He said state officials would do a flyover shortly to assess damage. Further inspections could reveal more damage, he warned.  Six structure fires were reported, John Callanan, Napa fire chief, said. In one of those fires, four mobile homes were destroyed.  64,000 without power  At least 64,000 people were without power at some point, state emergency officials said. By evening power had been restored to all but 17,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest power provider in the area.  CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Firefighters in the Napa Valley worked fast to slow home fires after arriving on scene to find water main breaks had damaged their ability to get water on the fires. VPC  Napa Police Capt. Steve Potter said the area's 911 system was briefly overwhelmed by calls that came in shortly after the quake, but the system quickly came back.  There were no reported highway blockages, though Huston said there was a report of a buckled offramp on state Highway 72 at Sonoma.  Napa is a picturesque town known for its lush vineyards, robust wines and rolling hills. There was no electricity downtown early Sunday as residents walked looking for damage. On Second Street, the masonry, wires and girders that make up the corner of the roof of a three-story historic building hung precariously over the sidewalk. A gaping hole was left where the masonry used to be. On the ground below a pile of bricks and rubble littered the sidewalk. Falling concrete damaged trees.  The historic Napa Valley Courthouse lost a portion of its roof, and police blocked off sections of the downtown to keep crowds away from the debris. Two other historical buildings — the Sam Kee Laundry, the Goodman Library — were also damaged.  ​  The state has not requested federal assistance, as it was still evaluating the damage, Brad Alexander, chief of media relations for California's Office of Emergency Services, said.  ""My Office of Emergency Services has been on full activation since early this morning and is working closely with state and local emergency managers, first responders and transportation officials to respond to impacts to residents and critical infrastructure,"" the governor said in a statement. ""These public safety officials are doing all they can to help residents and those living in affected areas should follow their guidance and instruction.""  Douglas Edwards, 27, Napa resident, said the earthquake woke him up from a sound sleep.  'It was just flash, flash, flash'  ""It was shaking so hard I was barely able to get myself and my daughter out,"" he said. ""When I stood up, the floor moved so much, I fell back down again. I ran outside and you could see the transformers exploding in the sky. It was just flash, flash, flash.""  Napa County Supervisor Bill Dodd inspected damage at the Napa County administration building Sunday morning.  ""It's devastated in there,"" he said. Ceilings collapsed, furniture scattered and file cabinets were upturned and on the floor. Dodd said normally the building would have been the site of emergency services coordination, however, because of the damage, emergency operations were moved to the sheriff's office in the southern part of the county.  ""It'll be some time before we can go back to work in there,"" he said.  Dodd said the historic three-story Winship building, which lost a corner of its roof, looks to be a total loss. He said it had been completely renovated 10 years ago, and the renovation included a seismic upgrade, which is supposed to make buildings able to withstand an earthquake.  In the city of Sonoma, west of Napa, police and fire officials reported no significant damage or injuries from the earthquake, officials said on the city's website. It said they had no information from PG&E about when power would be restored to those homes and businesses experiences outages.  The quake — which occurred at a depth of just less than 7 miles — was felt as far north as Sacramento and as far south as Santa Cruz and was immediately followed by a series of small aftershocks.  9 million feel shaking  According to USGS, nearly nine million people were estimated to have been exposed to varying levels of ground shaking.  It remains too early to provide a specific economic or insured loss estimate at this time, according to Aon Benfield, a reinsurance firm. However, the USGS's automated economic loss software predicted that there was a 27% chance that economic losses will end up beyond $1 billion, and a 35% chance that economic losses will top $100 million.  The USGS said the quake is likely to produce 30 to 70 small aftershocks with magnitude 3 to 5 within the next week. The probability of a strong and possibly damaging aftershock with a magnitude of 5 or greater in the next week is 54%, the USGS said.  The quake is the strongest temblor to hit the USA outside Alaska this year, according to USGS. About five quakes of this magnitude or stronger hit the USA each year, many in or near Alaska.

317,646,disaster,"GLENDORA (CBSLA.com) — The city of Glendora Thursday raised its alert level to red triggering a mandatory evacuation order due to the approaching storm.  The red alert went into effect at 10 p.m. as did the evacuation order for more than 1,000 residents living in the Colby Fire burn-area, officials said.  The city said the Crowther Teen Center at 241 W. Dawson is open.  “We recommend evacuations and the evacuations are mandatory. It doesn’t mean we’re going to go into their residences and force them to leave but we’re going to strongly advise that for their safety they should leave their residence. There is nothing they can do,” said Chief Tim Staab of the Glendora Police Department.  Officials also said the Inland Valley Humane Society will be available to offer assistance with small animals. If necessary, horses may be taken to the Pomona Fairgrounds, Gate 1.  “If the Colby Fire didn’t happen, all the flood control basins and debris basins would be doing their job. The fire is what caused all that,” said Vic Penrod with the Glendora Water Department.  Since the fire 11 months ago, three rainstorms have hit the area.  Pat Kozak, a Glendora resident, said he was expecting the worst.  “Last time, I wasn’t prepared so when it came down at 2 in the morning, I was running outside because we had such an inundation of water,” Kozak explained of a previous storm.  On Thursday, rocks, mud and sediment were being cleared out from the five debris basins located at the base of the burned-out hills.  By afternoon, a long-reach excavator was positioned near one of the storm channels in the event that debris blocks the free-flow of water. Across the region, K-rails and sandbags were in place.  “They have everything in place. As much as can be done is done and their just waiting for it to happen,” Penrod said.  Beginning at midnight, work crews are also expected to be positioned at all five debris basins to ensure that storm channels remain clear.

324,667,disaster,"People (L) take shelter beside a fallen tree as strong winds batter the coastal area in the Ky Anh district of Vietnam’s central Ha Tinh province on September 30, 2013. Vietnam evacuated tens of thousands of people from high-risk coastal areas on September 30 as a powerful typhoon that left dozens of fishermen missing in the South China Sea slammed into the country. AFP PHOTO  Vietnam evacuated tens of thousands of people from high-risk coastal areas Monday as a powerful typhoon that left dozens of fishermen missing in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, slammed into the country.  China deployed navy warships and aircraft to search for survivors after three Chinese fishing boats sank in rough waters whipped up by Typhoon Wutip.  More than 70 people were missing, Beijing’s official Xinhua news agency reported, citing maritime authorities.  Vietnam closed schools, ordered all boats ashore and moved some 70,000 people to shelters in vulnerable areas along its central coastline, as high winds and heavy rains uprooted trees and tore the roofs off houses.  Wutip made landfall on Vietnam’s central coast soon after 5:00 pm (10:00 GMT) packing winds of up to 103 kilometres (64 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 133 kph, Vietnam’s National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said.  Authorities scrambled to move people from areas at risk of landslides and flash floods, as soldiers joined efforts to build walls of sandbags around coastal villages.  “We have evacuated thousands of people, prepared vehicles, mobilised 5,000 police and soldiers,” Nguyen Duc Cuong, a local communist party official in Quang Tri province, told state-run VTV.  Torrential rain and strong winds battered neighboring Quang Nam Province, with the popular tourist town of Hoi An also affected by heavy flooding.  “This is a big typhoon with strong wind and heavy rain and we urge people to stay overnight in shelters,” Nguyen Van Bong, an official in nearby Ky Anh district, told state television.  Local authorities will be “on duty around the clock” to ensure the area’s reservoirs and vast hydro-electric dams are not damaged or made unsafe by the typhoon, he added.  People in central Vietnam told AFP that there were already sporadic power cuts in several districts.  Vietnam is hit by an average of eight to 10 tropical storms every year, often causing heavy material and human losses, as well as frequent flooding.  In recent weeks floods have killed at least 24 people in Vietnam and claimed 30 lives in Cambodia, as well as 22 in Thailand.  Cambodian police said four people — believed to be Syrians, including two children — died late Sunday when their car was swept away in floodwaters.  In China, President Xi Jinping called for an “all-out rescue effort” urging local authorities to “do their utmost to find the missing or stranded and minimise casualties” caused by the typhoon, Xinhua said.  Rescue efforts had been hampered by strong gales and high waves, it said.  The Chinese boats, which were together carrying 88 fishermen, sank after they attempted to navigate gales near the disputed Paracel Islands, about 330 kilometres (200 miles) from China’s southern coast.  China’s maritime authority on Sunday raised its alert on the typhoon to orange, its second-highest of four levels, Xinhua reported.  Storm tides might strike the provinces of Guangdong, Hainan and Guangxi, it added, citing the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Centre.  The Paracel islands are claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, but Chinese fishermen often travel there in search of bigger hauls.  Last week, Typhoon Usagi left at least 25 people dead after crashing ashore in southern China, throwing transport systems into chaos and leaving tens of thousands of airline passengers stranded in Hong Kong.  China’s civil affairs ministry said 226,000 people were relocated due to that storm and more than 7,100 houses collapsed or were badly damaged.

It continued to rain heavily on Wednesday, causing serious flooding in many areas, and threatened the lives of many residents including students in Khanh Hoa Province.  Three seventh-grade students of Tran Nhan Tong Secondary School in Khanh Hoa's Dien Khanh District drowned after falling into a pit at a construction site on Monday, police said.  The students fell into a 30m-long and 2m-deep pit when they stopped to play by the roadside after school, the police said.  The pit, which had been dug by a road construction firm, was filled with water because it had rained earlier. However, the construction agency had not placed any warning signs for residents.  The fourth student, 11-year-old Nguyen Thi Xuan Quyen, died while she was riding her bicycle to school on Monday morning. Due to the heavy rain, the road was inundated and resulted in Quyen falling into the canal and being washed away.  Quyen's body was found the next day.  Tran Minh Nghi, 42, resides in Nha Trang City reportedly died after she fell into a river on Monday, and Phung Vo, 76, from Ninh Hoa Town was reported missing while going fishing on Tuesday.  The Committee for Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue in Khanh Hoa province, said the rain had flooded 1,000 houses and affected a lot of shrimp breeding ponds.  On Wednesday morning, the Phu Kieng wooden bridge in Nha Trang City's Vinh Ngoc Commune was swept away as the water level in Cai River rose.  The Phu Kieng wooden bridge over the Cai River, links three villages on the other side of the river with the centre of Vinh Ngoc Commune.  Le Van My, chairman of Vinh Ngoc Commune's People's Committee said the destruction of the bridge could cause problems for residents living on both sides of the river.  He also said residents were hoping that a new bridge would be constructed as soon as possible to reduce traffic accidents.  Heavy rain combined with high tides caused severe landslides at the fishing port of Tuy Hoa City's Ward 6 in Phu Yen Province.  Local authorities have evacuated residents in the coastal areas to safety, while using rocks and sandbags to protect coastal erosion. Meanwhile, tidal waves caused severe erosion in Cua Lo area, of Binh Trung village, Tam Hai commune in Quang Nam province's Nui Thanh district, threatening the lives of dozens of households.

Northern Province Minister Freedom Sikazwe said a Zambian National Service land development unit based in Mansa in Luapula Province has also been dispatched to assess and put up a temporary  crossing.  “As far as food is concerned the disaster management unit has begun distributing the relief food, a fact that was confirmed to me by the District Commissioner in Kaputa,” Mr Sikazwe said.  While 30 tents had been put up to provide shelter to the 1,063 residents who were left homeless after their houses flooded and others collapsed following unrelenting rains in the area, Mr Sikazwe said an additional 100 tents were needed.  Mr Sikazwe, who was in Kaputa to assess the situation, directed the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit to begin the distribution of food and other materials to some of the families accommodated at a school.  The minister described the situation in Kaputa as dire, adding that what he feared the most was a possible outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases because lavatories were submerged and faecal matter had contaminated water sources.  A medical team had been dispatched but was making slow progress because of the bad condition of the road.  Mr Sikazwe assured the affected families that Government would provide all the necessities required to see them through the disaster.  He asked the provincial medical office to consider dispatching some mobile hospitals to Kaputa because they were four-wheel drive and could easily traverse the area.  Meanwhile, heavy rain have destroyed more than 450 crops fields in Nsama District.  The rain which resulted in flooding in Kaputa extended to Nsama where fields were flooded.  Nsama District Commissioner Panji Chilingala said yesterday that it was estimated that close to 600 fields of the staple maize and cassava could be affected.  Mr Chilangala, who described the situation as serious, said the compromised food security had pushed up mealie-meal prices to K150 per K25 bag.  He said the residents had appealed to Government to sell subsided maize to them through the FRA.  Times of Zambia",http://lusakavoice.com/2014/03/26/govt-distributes-relief-food-in-kaputa/,en

335,686,disaster,"A report from Human Rights Watch claims that the Zimbabwe government has used violence, harassment, and the deliberate restriction of humanitarian aid to coerce an estimated 20,000 flood victims to resettle on tiny land plots where the government plans to establish a sugar cane plantation.  The 20,000 flood victims were forced from their homes after the flooding in the Tokwe-Mukorsi dam basin in February 2014.  The Human Rights Watch report, “Homeless, Landless, and Destitute: The Plight of Zimbabwe’s Tokwe-Mukorsi Flood Victims,” documents human rights violations suffered by those displaced by the floods.  In the immediate aftermath of the flood, the Zimbabwean army relocated the 20,000 victims – or 3,300 families – to Chingwizi Camp on Nuanetsi Ranch, where they received assistance from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies. Conditions in the camps were known to be poor, as this report explains.  The government then told the flood victims that they should move to their new plots earmarked for sugar cane growing at Bongo and Nyoni, 20 kilometers away.  When the flood victims refused, government authorities began to deny them food assistance, limited their access to water and toilets, and barred or diverted aid donations intended for their assistance. In April 2014, the local government minister, Ignatious Chombo, said publicly that “food assistance will only be given to those families who agree to move to their permanent plots.” Within six months after the camp opened, the government closed it, along with its health clinic and school.  The victims were given no choice but to accept one-hectare plots of land on a farm earmarked for growing sugar cane that has close links to the ZANU-PF ruling party of President Robert Mugabe.  “The Zimbabwean government has stopped at nothing to coerce 20,000 flood victims to accept a resettlement package that provides labor for a government project, but leaves the flood victims utterly destitute,” said Dewa Mavhinga, southern Africa senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Zimbabwean government should immediately give the victims adequate aid without conditions and compensate them fairly for their losses.”  Floods Were Man Made  The ill-fated relocation began in February 2014, when heavy rains flooded the dam’s basin. The authorities maintain the floods were a natural disaster resulting from climate change, which resulted in record rainfalls. Dam project workers and an engineer familiar with the dam construction told Human Rights Watch, however, that the floods could have been prevented by letting out water downstream.  At the time of the flooding, our FloodList report “Threat of Imminent Kariba Dam Wall Collapse Denied” that there had been question marks over the imminent failure of the dam.  Satellite images of the floods taken between December 2013 and May 2014, and analyzed by Human Rights Watch, strongly suggest that there was no effort to reduce water levels or to minimize the flooding until weeks after the flooding began.  Despite residents’ pleas to allow water to flow downstream, armed soldiers evicted the residents from their land, including some far from the flood areas. One flood victim said that the soldiers told residents:  President Mugabe directed that this dam should be constructed so that it contains water in it, and you ask us to let the water out? No. It is time for you to leave now. You will receive your compensation later, when [the] government gets the money.  “The circumstances leading to the floods are suspicious and flood victims have a right to know if it could have been avoided, as many lost property in the emergency relocation,” Mavhinga said. “The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission should immediately investigate the circumstances leading to the floods and, if necessary, ensure that those responsible are held to account.”  Violence and Intimidation  Some of the flood victims were already slated for resettlement prior to the emergency, but had resisted moving without receiving fair compensation for their property. The government used violence and intimidation to quell protests, and restricted food distribution and health and education services to those who refused to accept government resettlement plans.  When flood victims protested, and violence broke out, anti-riot police indiscriminately beat and arrested about 300 people, mostly men, witnesses told Human Rights Watch.  Most of those arrested were later released, except one woman and three men, including Mike Mudyanembwa, the chair of the victims’ Chingwizi Camp Committee, who had not been at the demonstration. These four were charged with public violence and sentenced to five years in prison on January 27, 2015; their lawyers said they had been tortured in prison.  In the wake of the protests, many men fled the camp, fearing arrest. The police forced the women, the sick, and the disabled who remained to sit in the sun without access to toilets for two days as punishment, then moved them to the one-hectare plots.  1 Hectare Plots Inadequate  The flood victims oppose the government’s plans. They told Human Rights Watch that the plots are too small to support their families with basic kitchen gardens, that they had been promised five hectares, and that they are being given no choice but to grow sugar cane, which they have no experience cultivating. Many have received no compensation for the loss of their land.  The flood victims have been left destitute at the new plots. They said the last food aid distribution from the World Food Program (WFP) was in September 2014 and that they have to walk up to 20 kilometers for clean drinking water, since the boreholes the government constructed were dry or produced saltwater.  Sugar Cane and Ethanol Project  Under the government’s plans, the flood victims are required to grow sugar cane on Nuanetsi Ranch in the Mwenezi district of Masvingo province to contribute to a government-owned ethanol project. They would not be permitted to grow other crops. They said the arrangement would leave them with no livelihood until the scheme was fully operational, expected to be in about seven years.  The provincial affairs minister for Masvingo province, Kudakwashe Bhasikiti, told Human Rights Watch in an August 2014 interview that the flood victims would eventually benefit from the ethanol project and that families growing sugar cane would help the project achieve profitability more quickly than if they were permitted to grow crops of their choosing. In other interviews, Bhasikiti branded those who opposed the government’s plans as “rebels” and “enemies of the state.”",http://floodlist.com/africa/zimbabwe-tokwe-mukorsi-flood-victims-suffer-human-rights-violations,en

All relevant line ministries have introduced measures for immediate relief, e.g. shelter, food and care for the displaced, books for the children, chemical (disinfection) and physical (removal of carcasses) decontamination of the area, feed for the evacuated cattle etc. In a coordinated effort, the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth, with the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence collected humanitarian aid from citizens and have sent in-kind assistance as well as monetary and psychosocial assistance to evacuated families. Rapidly changing circumstances in the field, vastness of the flooded area, damage on the houses, other facilities, crops and cattle, threat of dislocated landmines and a large number of long-term displaced persons from Croatia, as well as from Bosnia and Hercegovina, along with continually arriving offers of assistance from our friends in the international community, prompted Croatia to issue a humanitarian appeal and ask for international assistance.","http://www.mvep.hr/en/info-servis/press-releases/floods-in-croatia-and-the-region---the-situation-analysis-on-28-may-2014,21657.html",en

470,134,disaster,"©Environment Canada In British Columbia, an overheated wildfire season scorched the third-biggest loss of timber in the province since authorities began recording wildfire statistics more than 60 years ago. Fires burned more than 338,000 hectares through the province – seven and a half times the normal area charred on average over 20 years. No homes or notable structures were destroyed, but the province more than quadrupled its firefighting budget, spending $266 million. Conditions for the wildfire season started in 2013 when places like Victoria experienced their driest October-to-December on record. Summer perfected conditions for igniting and spreading wildfires as average temperature across coastal and southern portions of the province made for the third-warmest summer over 67 years of record-keeping and one of the top ten driest summers. Record-high July maximum temperatures soared into the low 40s in several interior communities. Some places claimed it was the driest summer in more than half a century. Among the major fires were those that burned in vast dead pine forests killed by mountain pine beetles or on steep, inaccessible terrain, increasing risks and challenges to firefighters and communities. Nearly 400 firefighters from Ontario, the Maritimes, Alaska and even Australia pitched in to help. The biggest and most difficult forest fire was near the Chelaslie River south of Burns Lake in northwestern British Columbia. It burned 133,162 hectares, accounting for more than 30 per cent of land burned in the province this year. Another big fire occurred in northern British Columbia near the Alberta border when a lightning strike whipped by strong winds caused 3,800 hectares to burn at Red Deer Creek. And a fire at Smith Creek, west of Kelowna, forced 2,500 people out of their homes. Over the course of the summer a series of smoke advisories and special air quality statements, issued by the province and Environment Canada respectively, were put in place for many regions, including the Okanagan Valley where residents of Peachland were urged to keep small children, the elderly and pets inside. On occasion, even Vancouver and the Fraser Valley were subject to air quality advisories as smoke plumes hung heavy over the skies. ©Environment Canada",http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C8D88613-1&offset=4&toc=show,en

Conflict-related displacement since 2004 has been caused by fighting between the Pakistani military and non-state armed groups (NSAGs), clashes between NSAGs, sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims, tribal and local clashes over resources, and human rights abuses committed by both the military and NSAGs (IDMC, 12 June 2013, pp.3, 5; IDMC, 10 January 2012, pp.3, 8; The Friday Times, March 2012; HRCP, March 2013, p.279; IDMC, 6 September 2010, pp.21-24; AI, 2012; AI, June 2010, pp.11-15; ICG, 23 June 2014, pp.13-15; BBC, 22 February 2014; IRIN, 13 February 2014; Reuters, 21 May 2014). Information on numbers of IDPs in FATA and KP is regularly updated, while numbers on Balochistan are scarcer. Of the total number, up to 907,000 were newly displaced in 2014, all of them from FATA’s North Waziristan and Khyber agencies. This compares to 140,000; 412,000; 190,000; 400,000 and 3 million newly displaced in the five preceding years. The total number of people in displacement peaked at 3 million in 2009 (IDMC, 14 May 2014, p.74; IDMC, 29 April 2013, p.70; IDMC, 2 April 2012, p.90; IDMC, 1 March 2011, p.92; IDMC, 1 May 2010, p.82).

He, likewise, asked the government to relocate the people who live along water ways and compensate those who have been most affected by the flood. “If this is done, the people of the area can now have water transport as an option, as they can now use ferries to connect to other communities and states that have water bodies.

525,189,disaster,"Flooded pastures resembled rice paddies and crop fields featured lakes with whitecaps, leaving some of the best farmland in Canada too soggy to farm. Farmers feared losing their growing season altogether. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, well over one million acres of seeded fields were flooded or drowned and another two million were left unseeded. As much as six million acres of farmland in the west were damaged, drowned or lying on still-frozen ground. Even though some crops recovered from flooding, their high yields suffered. Total costs from flooding exceeded $1 billion as farmers lost crops and communities mopped up. Weeks later, waves of mosquitoes emerged from the sodden ground and standing waters. Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues. The seeds of this summer’s flood started in the fall of 2013, when already saturated soils, combined with high over-winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies. It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled. Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the greater incidence of multi-day rainfalls. Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual. The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim, and now the runoffs are moving overland in a “fill and spill process” that is ripping out roads, inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks. Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 60 per cent, and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 50 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 32 per cent.",http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C8D88613-1&offset=3&toc=show,en

In 2011, it was the combination of snowmelt and ice jamming that created a massive billion-dollar disaster across Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Last year, the coincidence of rapid snowmelt and heavy spring rains in southern Alberta generated the most disruptive, destructive and expensive flood in Canadian history – a $6 billion flood of floods. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a break in 2014 was sorely disappointed. This time water problems prevailed across the eastern Prairies just a week before summer began. Excessive rains on soggy ground − too much rain too fast over too many days – led to huge flooding and another billion-dollar disaster. ©Environment Canada On June 15, two major slow-moving weather systems, hours apart and more typical of spring or fall, combined to bring a few soggy days to the eastern Prairies.

The international community has been informed about the concrete needs, most of which can in best way be covered by direct financial assistance. In general, we have been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in Croatia for food, shelter and medical care, as well as provide assistance to the neighbouring countries. However, we anticipate that in the medium- and long-term there will be a gap between the immediate relief and subsequent rehabilitation, reconstruction and development. Currently, the water level has started to recede. All available forces for protection and rescue activities continue to work on strengthening the existing and in building new dikes, sharing food and water for vulnerable populations, rescuing survivors and disposing of animal carcasses. The situation remains complex due to landslides and road damages. State and local authorities are engaged in on-going evacuation efforts. Thorough analysis of the current situation in affected areas has already begun as well as a breakdown of necessary activities and tasks for the forthcoming period. Even though water levels have begun to recede there is a fear for new disasters since the area is contaminated with landmines and other non-exploded remnants of war. Due to the flooding the landmines may have been dislocated outside the previously marked locations, which make the subsequent assessment of the damage, clearing and the reconstruction of the flooded areas even more delicate and dangerous. The cleaning of landmines in two municipalities of Gunja and Vrbanja is estimated at the cost of 4 million euros.

This number is based on results from a re-registration exercise conducted in 2013-2014 by the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees. The figure is a slight increase from the initial figure released after the re-registration exercise for two reasons. First, some IDPs failed to participate in the re-registration process in 2013 and consequently had their status terminated. They are now gradually approaching the Ministry in order to re-register and have their statuses restored. Second, children with one IDP parent are entitled to the status. Each month about 400-500 newborns receive the status, which causes an increase in the IDP figure.

928,592,conflict,"This estimate is based on data obtained from various sources, including government agencies, international NGOs, UN agencies and the media. The government collects data on displacement caused by natural hazards and conflict (“social conflicts”) through the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB). However, with regards to conflict-related displacement, government IDP records do not cover all regions of the country or all displacements events. According to official figures, conflict and violence displaced 11,979 people between 2006 and 2015, including 505 in 2014. No displacement was recorded in the first 6 months of 2015 (BNPB, July 2015). However, this figure is likely to significantly under-estimate total displacement as it did not take into account ongoing displacement in Papua and West Papua provinces, as well as a number of displacement events elsewhere in the country. In August 2014 for example, some 500 people were reported displaced in Lembata, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), following inter-communal violence (Tempo, 18 August 2014). This was not included in the records of the BNPB. At the end of December 2014, BNPB reported that 2.6 million people had been displaced by natural hazard-related disasters in 2014 (Jakarta Post, 31 December 2014). However, available data from the BNPB database shows a much lower total, at 856,720 people (BNPB, January 2015). Collecting data on protracted displacement is complicated by the fact that many of the conflicts that have led to large-scale displacement took place more than 15 years ago and that information on the whereabouts and needs of IDPs, returnees and those who locally integrated or settled elsewhere is often not available. There is also no monitoring of return or other settlement options or any assessment of the extent to which these have been sustainable. While a number of programs implemented in recent years by local and international agencies in provinces such as Aceh, Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara have made partial data available, in others such as North Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West and Central Kalimantan no data has been available since 2005.",http://www.internal-displacement.org/south-and-south-east-asia/indonesia/figures-analysis,en

949,613,disaster,"While conditions were not favourable for wildfires in most areas of the country in 2014, it was still a huge wildfire year in Canada. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, although the absolute number of wildland fires was 10 per cent less than the 20-year average, the area burned was three times higher than the 20-year national average (4.6 million hectares vs. the normal 1.5 million hectares). So even with parts of Canada being, at times, soaked by heavy rains or underwater from floods, the Northwest Territories and British Columbia made up for it all with exceptional warmth and dryness that brought sparks to infernos in no time flat. ©Environment Canada In the Northwest Territories it started with a cold winter and scanty snows that left the ground and forest litter dry. With summer came clear skies and record warm temperatures that optimized already perfect conditions for fires to spread. The principal culprit was a stalled ridge of drying air anchored over the Mackenzie River valley for weeks. Temperatures from Tuktoyaktuk to Yellowknife averaged well above historic averages. The Mackenzie region averaged 1.6°C warmer than normal – the seventh warmest summer in 67 years. Yellowknife had 22 days in June and July at or above 25°C, compared to an average of eight, and only two days in June and three in July with rain. In a 91-day span, from the May long-weekend onwards, Yellowknife received only one-half its normal rainfall. As further evidence of the dryness, water levels in the Mackenzie River dropped to some of the lowest seen in more than 30 years. So it was no surprise to anyone that the Northwest Territories had its worst fire season in 30 years with nearly 3.4 million hectares razed. That’s seven times the normal acreage consumed and six times the size of Prince Edward Island. At the peak of the fire season, smoke, ash and moisture from intense fires travelled as high as 15 km in the air, easily circling the globe. Some plumes travelled south and east affecting air quality in the northern plains of the United States, the Canadian Maritimes and even as far as Portugal. The fires caused a host of problems, including highway closures due to reduced visibility, the destruction of fibre optic cables and the interruption of Yellowknife’s main power supply line. Health risks were also a concern as the city’s hospital treated twice the usual number of patients for respiratory and allergy issues. Smoke was so thick that, at times, it was hard to breathe indoors with the windows closed let alone venturing outside. Widespread forest fires also stranded visitors and adversely affected busy tourist camps and attractions. In August, firefighters and residents finally got a breather when cooler and wetter weather took hold. Temperatures dropped significantly and rainfall was 50 per cent more than normal for the month.",http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C8D88613-1&offset=4&toc=show,en

They are currently located in 6 collective centres in the adjacent region, as well as in many private homes of people who took them in. Further 36,000 people in Croatia are currently endangered by the floods. Over 17,000 school children are currently unable to attend school. There have been 2 casualties so far. Until now, 4,367 housing units have been flooded and we anticipate that around 30% of them will need to be demolished because they will most likely have to be deemed unsuitable for habitation. Around 50% of all crops have been destroyed, and around 21,000 cattle have been evacuated from the flooded area.

The study concluded that between 954,000 and 1.2 million people were internally displaced from 1986 to 2005 (Haceteppe University, 2006). The study included a qualitative and quantitative survey. The qualitative survey was conducted in five provinces, while the quantitative survey was based on a national random sample of around 6000 households. The household and individual interviews were conducted with those who returned to their village and those who remained in displacement. The quantitative survey questionnaire was prepared using the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and interviewees were selected through a random number table, also known as the ‘Kish’ method. IDPs fled their homes due to armed conflict between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).

1281,945,disaster,"The resilience of Canada’s oilsands industry over the past few weeks has been something to behold. Despite the massive (and, at the time of this writing, unextinguished) forest fire that ravaged parts of Fort McMurray, Alta., forced the evacuation of 90,000 residents and took an estimated 1.2 million barrels of daily capacity—1.4% of the global supply—offline, it has been quick to resume operations, even while the town remains deserted. Still, producers need the town to rebuild in order to operate effectively for the long term. Given the dire conditions facing the oil industry right now, that’s anything but certain. Shell Canada partially restarted its Albian Sands operation on May 9, just six days after shutting down. Enbridge Inc., the largest pipeline operator out of the Athabasca oilsands region, resumed operations on May 11, after a seven-day hiatus. Suncor Energy re-established some operations a few days later (only to evacuate again when the fire moved north). Canadian Natural Resources’ huge Horizon mine never shut down in the first place. None of this would have been possible a decade ago. Back then, investment in the oilsands was nearing its peak, and oil producers had a huge human resources headache. It was encapsulated in a paper by Deloitte entitled “The Producers’ Dilemma.” These companies had, on the one hand, a seemingly insatiable global demand for their product. On the other, they had a practically inexhaustible resource.",http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/canadas-oil-business-needs-fort-mcmurray-to-rebuild/,en
1282,946,other,"The problem was that a bottleneck—or, as some industry executives liked to put it, a door one shoulder-width wide—lay between the two. That door was the town of Fort McMurray. Though it was a fast-growing boom town, it was isolated and could hold only so many workers and contractors. If too many projects ramped up at the same time, wage rates and costs snowballed, schedules went to pieces and project economics evaporated. In the years to follow, companies found ways around that door. They built or leased work camps capable of housing some 15,000 individuals near their job sites outside the city. They laid down their own airstrips where they could land Boeing 737s filled with crews from as far away as the Maritimes for two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off shifts. Rather than build on-site, they bought components for their plants from suppliers in Asia, barged them in modules up the Mackenzie and Columbia river systems and shored up highways to haul the huge pieces the last few hundred kilometres to the work site. The town and the camps had an occasionally uneasy relationship. The camp dwellers sometimes depended on amenities in the town—police, medical services, recreational facilities—without being home-owning taxpayers. They didn’t have ties to schools or churches or amateur sports teams. Their most common reason to drive into town was to hit the bars. It’s not surprising that CNRL’s Horizon kept operating through the evacuation—it relies on local labour for less than a quarter of its workforce.",http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/canadas-oil-business-needs-fort-mcmurray-to-rebuild/,en
1283,947,disaster,"Nonetheless, these workarounds by the oil companies played a critical role in the recent conflagration, both in safely evacuating Fort McMurray residents and in enabling producers to quickly ramp up again. “Broadly speaking, we have enough camps in place to be able to start the operations up,” Suncor CEO Steve Williams said at a press conference following the May 10 meeting between Premier Rachel Notley and executives representing 15 companies. Restarting quickly is an important achievement, before competing oil supplies cut into the supply chains of the producers’ refining customers. But that doesn’t mean the industry is out of the smouldering woods. Whether or not their homes were among the 2,400 buildings that have burned, residents who had been laid off or whose business was slow prior to the fire are likely to use the evacuation as their cue to start fresh somewhere else, says Joseph Doucet, dean of the University of Alberta School of Business. “The rebuilding of the town will be a function of the economic activity and prospects of Fort McMurray,” he says. Even before the fire, those prospects didn’t look bright. High-cost basins like the oilsands don’t thrive in low-oil-price environments. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers had forecast just $20 billion in capital expenditures in the oilsands this year, down from $35.7 billion in 2015 (which itself represented a 30% decline from the previous year). As of April, unemployment in the surrounding Wood Buffalo–Cold Lake region stood at 10.2%. While the oilsands producers have demonstrated their ability to keep running even without Fort McMurray, the town’s revival does matter to them. “The camps were designed for the construction crews,” Doucet notes. Because of the drop-off in investment, that category of workers is expected to decline by 10,305 positions between now and 2020, according to a report released in April by Petroleum Labour Market Information, a division of industry training body Enform. At the same time, PetroLMI projects a need for 9,870 more people to operate and maintain existing plants, mines and well pads—jobs traditionally (and most cost-effectively) performed by local employees, who take care of their own room, board and transportation.",http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/canadas-oil-business-needs-fort-mcmurray-to-rebuild/,en

1355,1019,other,"An enormous spike in the number of Haitian migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico over the past year prompted President Barack Obama’s administration this month to order a sudden policy reversal and served as a reminder of the dysfunction and despair driving people from the hemisphere’s poorest nation. Better prospects in Haiti depend on political stability, which is at a make-or-break juncture. With a redo, scheduled Oct. 9, of last year’s failed, allegedly fraud-ridden presidential vote, Haiti has a chance to regain a measure of prosperity following years of mismanagement and suffering. It must seize that chance. A devastating earthquake in 2010 led U.S. officials to adopt a lenient stance toward Haitian migrants without visas, who have been granted admission and temporary work permits on the grounds that conditions in Haiti were so dire. The administration abruptly reversed course this month after more than 5,000 Haitians, many of whom had undertaken an odyssey through South and Central America, were processed through the San Ysidro Port of Entry near San Diego since last October. Just 339 Haitians crossed there in all of fiscal 2015.",http://www.middletownpress.com/opinion/20160930/editorial-haitis-second-chance,en

While most of the 1.5 million people displaced by the earthquake have been resettled, economic growth is all but nonexistent. Investment is sluggish, and a drought has contributed to food shortages. Advertisement In fact, the administration could ill afford another migrant crisis; hence the change in policy on Haitian migrants. For a more durable solution, what is needed as a first step is a fair and transparent election in Haiti, whose political history offers few such examples.",http://www.middletownpress.com/opinion/20160930/editorial-haitis-second-chance,en

U.S. officials, who provided most of the election funding, deemed it good enough; so did some European observers. That just reinforced the widespread view in Haiti that Washington was in bed with the then-ruling party, whose candidate finished first despite being a political novice. Following months of postponements and squabbles, the results of that vote were annulled and the runoff, originally scheduled for January, was canceled. The question now is whether the rerun, set for a week from Sunday and funded this time by Haiti without international help, will be an improvement. There are encouraging signs, including an electoral council that has undertaken more training for poll workers and supervisors and, it is to be hoped, arranged for indelible ink to verify voting; the ink used last year washed off.",http://www.middletownpress.com/opinion/20160930/editorial-haitis-second-chance,en

Abandoned cars were pushed to the side of the road, lawn furniture and children’s toys floating through the waters. The low pressure system that wreaked such havoc moved into Texas, but the National Weather Service warned that there’s still danger of fresh floods, as swollen rivers drain toward the Gulf of Mexico.

People at the church used boats and big trucks to rescue others and bring them to the church, where helicopters started picking them up and flying them to safety Sunday. Matthew, 29, said between 250 and 300 people were still at the church as of late afternoon Sunday. Water was creeping up to the back of the sanctuary, and they didn’t have any food or water there. “Everybody is just tired and nervous and wanting to see what kind of damage they have to their home,” Rachel said. Steele said the flooding that started Friday has damaged more than 1,000 homes in East Baton Rouge Parish, more than 1,000 homes in Livingston Parish, and hundreds more in other areas, including St. Helena and Tangipahoa parishes. Gov Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday, calling the floods “unprecedented” and “historic.” He and his family were even forced to leave the Governor’s Mansion when chest-high water filled the basement and electricity was shut off. In one dramatic rescue Saturday, two men on a boat pulled a woman from a car almost completely underwater, according to video by WAFB. The woman, who’s not initially visible on camera, yells from inside the car: “Oh my god, I’m drowning.” One of the rescuers, David Phung, jumps into the brown water and pulls the woman to safety. She pleads with Phung to get her dog, but he can’t find it. After several seconds, Phung takes a deep breath, goes underwater and resurfaces – with the small dog.

I didn’t just lose my home, I also lost my husband. I have nothing left back in Myanmar.” This is just one of many harrowing accounts relayed by Rohingya refugees in Malaysia when I sat down to chat with them months ago. It is a common story.

These latest spades of attacks have taken the Malaysian public sphere by storm as citizens share words of solidarity with those in suffering and voice out strong objections. Recently, the Malaysian government’s tone towards Myanmar has escalated in anger and sternness in response to violence in the Rakhine State, where the military clampdown has sent hundreds scampering across the border to Bangladesh. However, many expressed their displeasure that the Malaysian government is “allegedly” only paying lip service and not doing their part to lift the Rohingya’s sorrows. They are generally unhappy with Malaysia’s status as a non-party in the 1951 Refugee Convention and our country’s “perceived” ill-treatment of displaced people. However, things are not as black and white as I once thought; the refugee situation in Malaysia, South-east Asia, and the world is not defined in binaries.",http://www.themalaymailonline.com/what-you-think/article/malaysia-a-place-of-refuge-bernard-goh,en
1433,1097,other,"Firstly, the 1951 Refugee Convention is outdated and ill-suited to serve as a framework for today’s complex global migratory problems. Unfortunately, the convention is still the final arbiter for refugee migration, with its archaic and narrow distinction between genuine and illegitimate irregular migrants. This convention was drafted as an answer to the World War II refugee crisis where around 20 to 30 million people were displaced within Europe alone. At the onset of the Cold War, the new wave of European migrants was mostly comprised of those escaping communism and the oppression that came with it. The repercussions of sending such refugees back to their countries of origin were dire as communist nations purposefully and mercilessly persecuted returning citizens. This led to the definition of refugees as individuals with a “well-founded fear of being persecuted.” The refugees of today, however, are mostly displaced not because of politics but due to economic hardship or sectarian conflict. They are not fleeing totalitarianism and state-sponsored oppression but economic scarcity, lack of opportunities, and insecurity. The majority of those who reside in contemporary refugee camps would not fit the convention’s standard. Malaysia doesn’t need to and shouldn’t sign the convention as it is outdated. Despite not being party to the treaty, Malaysia’s treatment and leniency towards those displaced by war, poverty, and oppression have been exemplary.",http://www.themalaymailonline.com/what-you-think/article/malaysia-a-place-of-refuge-bernard-goh,en
1434,1098,other,"Comparatively speaking, Malaysia is much more humane and accommodating towards asylum seekers when compared to some of the countries often brought up for comparison, like Singapore and Australia. For instance, Malaysian authorities have generally turned a blind eye towards the existence of asylum seekers in the country. They are allowed to live in relative peace and security if they are legal and have received refugee identification cards from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). These legal refugees are allowed to stay in Malaysia until their resettlement to “destination” countries like the United States. With no definite timeline, there is generally an understanding that leniency exists to allow them to stay until resettlement or reparation. Take Singapore for instance: Asylum seekers are flat-out denied right of entry. This refusal is generally justified by the city state’s perceived land size limitations, which doesn’t stand up to judicious scrutiny. This is because it contradicts Singapore’s own ambitions to grow its population to 7 million from 5.5 million by 2030, coupled with known efforts to reclaim and increase land area. Now, let’s compare Malaysia to Australia. Australia is infamous for its offshore refugee detention camps that equate to torture. Asylum seekers en route to Australia by sea are intercepted and redirected to camps in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, indefinitely. The conditions in these camps are often cited as completely inadequate, unhygienic, and cramped.",http://www.themalaymailonline.com/what-you-think/article/malaysia-a-place-of-refuge-bernard-goh,en

Instead, they may be settled in either Nauru or Papua New Guinea. Malaysia is already doing more than its neighbouring countries — of much better “perceived” repute — when it comes to allowing foreign residents to claim asylum and seek shelter in Malaysia during processing. Our system is comparable with Canada’s where asylum can be claimed within Canada and a date for a formal hearing to determine refugee status will be set by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board. Asylum seekers in Malaysia and Canada both have access to community support such as legal NGOS and humanitarian agencies. On employment, asylum seekers are generally not allowed to seek legal employment and formal education for a myriad of complex reasons, such as the lack of opportunities for Malaysian citizens themselves and the fact that the majority of them are economic migrants, not genuine refugees.",http://www.themalaymailonline.com/what-you-think/article/malaysia-a-place-of-refuge-bernard-goh,en

On top of that, the children of asylum seekers are also allowed to enroll into schools run by the local community and NGOs. These children have often been able to pursue education up to the secondary level, with some even qualifying for college. Moving forward, the UNHCR in Malaysia has recently announced it was working with the authorities on a pilot scheme to allow Rohingya refugees to work in the country. Under the pilot programme, a group of 300 Rohingya would be authorised to be legally employed in the plantation and manufacturing industry paving the way for a comprehensive employment scheme for refugees in Malaysia. This is great progress seeing as relaxing the refugee work policy might cause an influx of migrant workers. However, Malaysian authorities are leading the way to allow refugees in Malaysia to increase their self-reliance and contribute to the Malaysian labour market. Contrary to public opinion, Malaysia’s stance and treatment towards asylum seekers are enviable compared to its neighbouring countries. There lies no doubt that Malaysia has contributed significantly to assist those genuinely fleeing persecution in their home countries and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. I am proud to say that the Malaysian government has done remarkably well, despite the difficulty of balancing domestic needs and international obligations.

1502,1166,disaster,"Ahmad Wani remembers Oct. 8, 2005. It was the day when at 8:50 a.m. Pakistan Standard Time, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck his home in Kashmir killing more than 70,000 people and displacing another 4 million. He recalls the devastation clearly, the homes left in shambles, the shortages of food and water, the many lives torn asunder in the course of seconds. “Having been one of the lucky few who lived through the disaster, I could see rescue authorities going around trying their best to rescue people,” Wani said. “However, the scale of the disaster was so large that they couldn't identify who needed to be rescued first, and what the priorities for rescue were.” First responders were burdened by a lack of proper tools to coordinate efforts and clear blocked roadways to extricate victims. The aftermath’s resulting pandemonium — and subsequent national and international earthquakes that followed — led Wani, along with his fellow Stanford University alumni Nicole Hu and Timothy Frank, to create One Concern. The startup aspires to be one of the first to use artificial intelligence to save lives through analytical disaster assessment and calculated damage estimates. Wani said that with the platform, emergency operations centers (EOCs) can receive instant recommendations on response priorities and other insights to dispatch resources effectively.",http://www.govtech.com/One-Concern-Applying-Artificial-IntelligenceI-to-Emergency-Management.html,en

When I was 17 years old, in 2005, 70,000 people lost their lives in an earthquake in my hometown. This event compelled me to study engineering and specifically in 2005, start performing earthquake engineering research. Then, in 2014, a combination of two events on different sides of the world inspired the creation of One Concern. In 2014, during a break from graduate school at Stanford, I was visiting my parents in Kashmir when a large flood engulfed the state. Eighty percent of Kashmir went under water within minutes! Most people were on their rooftops for up to seven days without food and water, waiting for rescue. Thousands of people lost their lives ... most of the rescue was random, and response priorities were ad hoc.

1505,1169,disaster,"Thereafter, upon my return to the Bay Area, I discovered that a natural disaster had struck in California, in Napa County, while I was away. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake on Aug. 24, 2014, in Napa had driven thousands of 911 calls, and overwhelmed the authorities who carried out the rescue effort on a first­-come­, first­-served basis. Power and communication lines were not fully restored for weeks. In fact, most of the badly damaged regions did not even have connections to a phone network and couldn’t call in for help — which has been seen in nearly all of the previous earthquakes. Napa was just a magnitude 6.0 earthquake, which caused minor or no damage in most regions. I seemed to imagine the situation in a magnitude 7.0 earthquake (nearly 10 times larger than a magnitude 6.0) or a magnitude 8.0 (nearly 100 times larger), for which there is significant probability of occurrence in California. Not just Napa, but 25 other counties could be very badly hit and out of network. I recognized at that point there would be a huge need for situational awareness, for driving rescue and relief operations. It was clear that difficulties in the chaos following a natural disaster were not limited to the developing world. It is a worldwide issue and it affects all regions vulnerable to any kind of natural disaster. Not only rescue, but the importance of reconnaissance and recovery also became apparent.",http://www.govtech.com/One-Concern-Applying-Artificial-IntelligenceI-to-Emergency-Management.html,en

First up was earthquakes, as I was studying earthquake engineering at Stanford. I partnered with Nicole Hu and Timothy Frank, who were both driven to solve this problem based on their unique previous experiences. Nicole, at the time a computer science grad student, had worked for large companies in data science and Web security, but she was looking for a real-­world problem that could really make a positive impact on people's lives. Timothy, a major in the U.S. Air Force and a Ph.D. candidate in structural engineering, had several years of experience in emergency management and disaster response. He was well aware of the current tools and processes in addition to the challenges and pain points that those in the emergency response community face. Like Nicole and me, Timothy was also driven by the impact this project could have on saving lives and strengthening communities. A combined class project between the Machine Learning and Performance Based Earthquake Engineering courses at Stanford was undertaken. Results of the project were compared with historical records. The goal was to see if damage to homes could be predicted on a community scale for the Napa earthquake. Results showed that our machine learning model accurately predicted structural damage to homes on a scale of 1-to-4 with significant accuracy. At the public presentation for the machine learning course, a venture capitalist — who turned out to be our first investor and trusted adviser and mentor — Mar Hershenson of Pejman Mar Ventures, stopped by to chat. She said if we were interested in starting a company, to let her know. Then, Stanford Machine Learning Professor Andrew Ng, famous for his pioneering roles with the Google Brain project and Coursera, stopped by to see our project. He immediately saw a need for it in the real­ world, and offered his support and advice to start a company, and to develop the class project into something more robust. It didn't take the three of us long to commit to taking the project forward and see if we can make a difference to communities all over California, the U.S. and the world.",http://www.govtech.com/One-Concern-Applying-Artificial-IntelligenceI-to-Emergency-Management.html,en

1508,1172,disaster,"Wani: Our vision is to change the way society plans for, responds to and recovers from all types of natural disasters. Currently we provide critical situational awareness in the minutes and hours following an earthquake. Our core product is a Web platform called “Seismic Concern” that alerts you when an earthquake may have affected your jurisdiction, and displays a color-coded map of the likely structural damage. This saves time in reconnaissance and allows emergency operations centers to allocate their limited resources to rescue and recovery. It gets all the stakeholders a common operating picture and not only facilitates response prioritization, but also recovery operations such as material staging and shelter management. Apart from the map, the platform furnishes key insights like the elderly population in a particular block that is badly damaged, or the number of kids in a school which could be hit. This helps in instant situational awareness and assigning response priorities to the places that need the most help. For instance, an elementary school wouldn’t be prioritized if an earthquake struck at midnight, but if it hit at 10 a.m. on a schoolday, it might jump to the top of the response priority list. Moreover, going to the phone network being jammed or lines being down, most people who have the worst damage cannot call 911. Seismic Concern is built on geographically distributed servers and redundant systems, which means our site will be up during an emergency when the emergency operations center needs it most. Compiling an Initial Damage Estimate (IDE) is critical for emergency operation centers to request financial aid from state level and federal authorities. Initially done using a wind­shield tour, wherein emergency managers carry out a quick reconnaissance survey of the area, street by street, it took around two months of time after the [2014] Napa earthquake to complete the process of requesting financial aid. ""Seismic Concern"" would provide a scientific basis to an IDE, an incident commander would be able to identify and quantify extent of damage to his jurisdiction with a significant amount of accuracy in minutes, thus saving a lot of time, and promising high precision.",http://www.govtech.com/One-Concern-Applying-Artificial-IntelligenceI-to-Emergency-Management.html,en

""This dangerous gesture of defiance should not have happened, but it is hard to know if the attack is an indication of Al Houthis making a deliberate refusal to join any new talks, or at best a misguided effort to show off some of their military prowess before starting talks again,"" said Gulf News in an editorial on Monday.""",http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/247152319,en

""The key new element in the plan is a suggestion that the GCC states and the legitimate government of Yemen need not insist on all these conditions being fulfilled before the formation of a new unity government.

1603,1267,conflict,"Phil Butler, is a policy investigator and analyst, a political scientist and expert on Eastern Europe, exclusively for the online magazine ""New Eastern Outlook"". War criminal, the term loses its bite typed onto a Microsoft Word document. If you think about what it means to be a criminal in war, operating from within humanity's ultimate inhumane situation, you will discover the devil within us all. So make no mistake about it, condemned ex-pilot Nadezhda Savchenko is not some heroine of the people of Ukraine, but a criminal in a criminal war on a people.The civil war in Ukraine has been one of the great tragedies of modern times. Even though hardly anyone in the western world realizes or even cares, the United States and her allies instigated the overthrow of a stable government way before the Euromaidan. But, trying to tell this story, in English especially, it always falls on deaf ears. Be that as it may, when Nadezhda Savchenko gave away the positions of two Russian reporters so that her comrades could rain down mortar shells on their position, she committed a crime in war. Now a Donetsk City Court in southern Russia's Rostov Region has found her guilty of complicity in the murder of Russian journalists Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin in eastern Ukraine, and has sentenced her to 22 years in prison. The BBC and Reuters can slice and dice this story all they like, but the fact is the former Ukraine military officer is guilty as sin.Now, for my bleeding heart American countrymen reading this, please consider this. In America, someone who plants 50 marijuana plants can get 20 years in prison and a $1 million dollar fine. And an accessory to murder will go to jail for between 20 and 30 years, if you catch my intentions here.But what kind of psychopathic Nazi does it take to join an army intent on murdering its own people? While I've no time or space to educate anyone on the war for the Donbass here, the regime of Petro Poroshenko, put in place byAs for our heroine, Malibu Nadezhda, she branded herself a fascist when she joined one of Poroshenko's most bloodthirsty and vile units, the Aidar Battalion. In 2014, Savchenko took the moral decision to join an extreme right wing, volunteer personal army of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoyski. This is irrefutable; this is the truth of the matter. But let me clarify for you some more.In 2014, Amnesty International condemned the Aidar Batallion for having committed war crimes , including abductions, unlawful detention, ill-treatment, theft, extortion, and possibly executions against the people of the Donbass. These Nazis were also condemned for blockading humanitarian aid to their own people, former citizens of Ukraine, in an effort to starve them to death. Even the members of Poroshenko's government accused the Aidar Batallion of committing a ""rain of terror"" on the regions they occupied. Eventually the government disbanded the unit, after elements of the battalion turned like rabid dogs on the Kiev regime itself. The accounts, police reports, news reports , eyewitness testimonies even I have heard, condemn the members of this para-military unit as criminals.Now, as it suits the perpetrators of the Ukraine unrest, a psychotic killer is transformed into an heroic figure, a hunger striking angel of mercy and valor, a tool to bruise your mind into thinking a homicidal maniac is Miss America. The reality is, like so much of this conflict, exactly the opposite. The Guardian or the BBC, Reuters or the New York Times will not bring you the real story. The fact is, those reporters are afraid too. I can prove this, many have told me so in confidence. The people who own the western press do not want you to know who this Savchenko woman is. If you truly know, then the people of Donbass, the so-called Pro-Russians would be the victims, the heroes - and Washington cannot have that. I recall an account of Aidar Batallion terror from the blockaded Crimea Peninsula. It is an account which may help you reconcile why Vladimir Putin moved in to protect Russian speakers in Crimea.The local residents of this Kherson region did not stand by to be raped and slaughtered, they did not wait for the Kiev criminals to come and rescue them either. No, the US Marines, Chuck Norris, nor Arnold Schwarzenegger were not parachuted in to save the day. The local hunters, the shopkeepers, the old war veterans gathered themselves, like heroes from a Hollywood western, to protect their own. But Americans cannot get off the hook so easy in my story. Do you know who the Aidar Battalion scum on the frontiers and in these villages are? Well, I'll quote one account:I'll let it all sink in for you now. But don't argue, please. Don't let your mind sway for even an instant, for I've volumes of stories, hundreds and thousands of witnesses, photos, video, documents, doctors, lawyers, and Babushkas who will swear a blood oath what I am telling you is true. At this point, no one who has been part of this attack on Russia and Russians, this NATO expansion debacle, gives a damn about anybody's argument for anybody who's a member of the Aidar Batallion.In wars where there are no rules, prisoners are not treated according to the Geneva Convention. But Nadezhda was, and she got her trial too. As I ponder the unfairness of western government leaders, of sold out media like BBC and the others, I cannot help but recall a lady named Anna Tuv. Global Research and many other independent media covered her sad situation. My friend and comrade, the American war fighter, Russell ""Texas"" Bailey is the closest to that horrific tale though. I've watched as he and friends like Graham Phillips have come to the aid of people like Anna, whose lives have been blasted out of peaceful existence, and into a lifelong type of hell.Anna has never been interviewed by BBC. Reuters has never covered how it was possible for an American backed army to murder a woman's family in a dog patch, non-strategic spot on eastern Ukraine. The Obama State Department is not up in arms demanding that Anna Tuv be avenged, heralded, put on a pedestal for her clear bravery and perseverance! Anna was not the poster girl for a Nazi crime unit, a killer with a mission from Satan himself. If I seem too adamant here, you'll excuse the hell out of me please. I fought for my country, I did my service, I am still doing my service to America. I can tell you the only western press story about Anna Tuv, it's written by another Nazi sympathizer, the Daily Beast Putin hater and hack of ousted oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Anna Nemtsova. Believe it or not, she uses Tuv as a tool to try and bash the Russian media, and that's all. One story, and a negative one at that, that's all! Can you feel my anger?So, if you are so inclined, you may pine on about the poor, pitiful school girl in chains and under Vladimir Putin's boot heel. Lieutenant Savchenko is lucky as hell though. World War II General, George Patton would have blown her brains out on the spot. Stalin's men would have flayed her skin like a Luftwaffe pilot, hung high on a tree. The Saudis would have certainly chopped her head off, and left her to bleed out into the desert sands. Even in America, Savchenko would be tucked away in a women's prison for life, left to wake each day to the horrors of the night before. But instead, Vladimir Putin sits in the Kremlin, pondering trading her for two Russians kept in detention in Ukraine - Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Aleksandrov.",http://www.sott.net/article/316243-Ukrainian-pilot-Nadia-Savchenko-is-a-contemptible-war-criminal,en

At this stage of the campaign, with both candidates established as their party’s nominees, journalists need to repeatedly to confront the candidates with questions about how they plan to approach this problem. Foreign policy, more than any other aspect of governance, is shaped and carried out by the executive branch, and we’re entitled to know how the candidates plan to approach it. Neither candidate should be allowed by journalists (or any other interlocutor) to get away with offering bromides or suggesting remedies that amount to, “I will wave a magic wand.” David Hazony has written an interesting essay about Obama’s mind in the Tower. I agree with parts of it and disagree with others. I don’t know if Obama’s Syria policy can be explained entirely by his Iran policy. None of us can really know until the archives are open, which may not be in our lifetimes. But I think Hazony’s right to say that this is where we now find ourselves: The result of U.S. inaction, when action was possible and proposed, in order to make sure nothing stopped the Iran deal, has been the perpetuation of Assad’s brutality and the glaring perpetuation of a war that pits radical Sunnis against Shiites against Kurds against less-radical Sunnis against an Alawite regime, with Russia and Turkey and Iran and Saudi Arabia vying for influence, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and many millions displaced. Syria is now a country that will never be whole again but may also never successfully break apart. It is a war that could last a hundred years. “By not intervening early,” French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Goldberg, “we have created a monster.” How big of a monster? Estimates range as high as 400,000 dead and tens of millions displaced. Think about it: From a humanitarian perspective, the devastation resulting from the effort to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb may have already exceeded the devastation that would result from Iran actually dropping a nuclear bomb.",https://ricochet.com/the-syrian-vortex/,en

So how are the Pentagon and the intelligence community responding? By catfighting among themselves. Two Department of Defense officials told The Daily Beast that they are not eager to support the rebels in the city of Aleppo because they’re seen as being affiliated with al Qaeda in Syria, or Jabhat al-Nusra. The CIA, which supports those rebel groups, rejects that claim, saying alliances of convenience in the face of a mounting Russian-led offensive have created marriages of battlefield necessity, not ideology. “It is a strange thing that DoD hall chatter mimics Russian propaganda,” one U.S. official, who supports the intelligence community position, wryly noted to Pentagon claims that the opposition and Nusra are one in the same. But even if the rebels were completely separated from Nusra, there would still be something of a strategic conflict with U.S. military goals. The rebels in Aleppo, these Pentagon officials note, are fighting the Bashar al-Assad regime; the American military effort, on the other hand, is primarily about defeating the self-proclaimed Islamic State.",https://ricochet.com/the-syrian-vortex/,en

It’s definitely not too much to ask of a candidate at this stage that he or she have a grasp on what’s being openly reported, in English, about the conflict and our approach to it. We deserve a clear and consistent answer to questions like these: We reportedly have 250 boots on the ground in Syria. Do you anticipate needing more? If so, do you plan to consult Congress before authorizing this, or do you believe this should be a decision made exclusively in the executive branch? What is our objective in Syria? Do you agree that ISIS cannot be defeated so long as Assad is in power? If so, what do you think it would take to dislodge Assad? Are you willing to risk direct conflict with Russia and Iran to do it? If not, are you willing to cede American influence throughout Europe and the Middle East to Russia and Iran? Does it make sense to you to enter an alliance of convenience with al Qaeda to dislodge Assad? Have you considered the risks of this policy? How do you plan to mitigate them? Given the renewed Russian assault, the odds are high that by the time you’re in office, Assad’s regime, backed by Russia, will still be in power.

Assad’s acts of murder, as Hazony (correctly) points out, “eclipse those of ISIS by orders of magnitude.” It’s Assad, not ISIS, who is an arm of an expansionist Iranian empire. If he really plans — diplomatically, or in fact — to ally the United States with Russia and Iran in committing crimes like this, voters need to grasp what that entails. Hazony sees it this way, This is not to say that ISIS isn’t a vicious problem.

Sikorsky President Dan Schultz presented the recognition to Bristow President and CEO Jonathan Baliff in a ceremony at the 2016 Helicopter Association International Heli-Expo show.

The barge, which was being used to transport cargo, was returning to Norway from Tunisia when the tow line broke. Bristow’s mission was to evacuate offshore personnel away from the threatened platforms to other rigs in the area outside the danger area and to a safe onshore location as quickly as possible, then transport personnel back to their worksites in the following days.

In light of the enormous and long process to recovery and rehabilitation ahead of us, and in the name of the Fijian people, I am calling on the international community`s assistance, "" Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama said. He said that relief efforts are in full swing and Fiji is prioritizing the restoration of such essential services as education, health, infrastructure and agriculture. Winston, the most devastating tropical cyclone on record in the Southern Hemisphere, struck the Pacific island nation on 20 February, taking more than 40 lives and affecting 350,000 people, 40 per cent of the total population. Some 54,000 people remain sheltered in 960 evacuation centres. While comprehensive data on the damage is still being collected, initial estimates indicate varying levels of destruction, with up to 100 per cent of buildings destroyed on some islands. Hundreds of schools have been damaged or destroyed, health facilities have been severely damaged and the agricultural sector faces a total loss of some $56 million. Almost no part of our nation has been left unscarred, and many of our rural and maritime areas bore the brunt of Winston`s fury, "" said Nazhat Shameem Khan, Fiji`s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva. On Koro Island alone, more than 3,000 people were left homeless, with 21 per cent of livestock dead and any crop yield made impossible. This is a loss of catastrophic proportions for Fiji, and the immediate loss will be followed by a longer term loss to Fiji`s economic and social growth, "" Mr. Khan said. We have suffered a terrible blow to infrastructure, health, education, and agriculture. It is a blow which will take us years to recover from. The moment is now, for our friends to stand by the people of Fiji. "" For its part, the UN, together with its humanitarian partners, is supporting Fiji in their response to the catastrophe. It is vital that the international community provides the necessary resources so we can help all the affected people with shelter, health services, water and sanitation, and support students to restart their education, "" said Marcy Vigoda, Chief of Partnerships and Resource Mobilization in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Geneva.

Most of those homes burned in a short period Thursday evening as high winds pushed the blaze east over a ridge. The fire left behind scorched brick, concrete and steel, but consumed almost everything else in some areas. After examining the damage, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood said he believes the death toll will rise.

The world’s youngest country, which only obtained independence from its northern neighbor Sudan in 2011, is currently hosting its first-ever movie gala. Running from Monday until Thursday July 7, the Juba Film Festival is showcasing the work of local and international filmmakers in a bid to change perceptions of a country that, outside its borders, is largely associated with the horrors of war. The festival was the brainchild of Simon Bingo, 29, a Juba filmmaker. Bingo says that he hopes culture can help the South Sudanese to “find our own identity,” rather than being branded as warmongers. “What we know now is that people are talking of South Sudanese as fighters, war people [who] like fighting, but we are struggling to try to change that,” says Bingo, speaking to Newsweek from Juba.",http://www.newsweek.com/juba-identity-south-sudans-first-film-festival-offers-new-image-war-torn-478131,en

But after realizing its dream of a separate country, South Sudan was plunged into conflict again when fighting broke out between supporters of President Salva Kiir and then-Vice President Riek Machar. The violence quickly morphed into a full-scale civil war, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced more than 2 million South Sudanese. While sporadic outbursts of fighting continue, a peace agreement was signed in August 2015 and Machar was recently rehabilitated into the government and reassumed his post of vice-president. As the country looks to rebuild itself, Bingo says that culture and the arts can play a key role. “South Sudan has a lot of promising filmmakers and actually the audience [as well]—the people love films,” he says. “So there is the potential that we will be having young filmmakers coming out of South Sudan very soon.” The festival has a busy program with a series of short and longer films being shown at the Nyakuron Cultural Center in Juba, a theater that Bingo describes as having a capacity of around 900 people and being close to full on Monday. It will conclude with an prize ceremony on Thursday, where nominees in a variety of categories—director, editor, actor etc—will be feted for their work.",http://www.newsweek.com/juba-identity-south-sudans-first-film-festival-offers-new-image-war-torn-478131,en

The practice involves women straddling the cooling, perfumed embers of a fire in the belief that smoke smooths the skin and tightens the vagina, thereby giving greater sexual pleasure to her husband.

2804,2468,disaster,"Chinese visitors would be crucial to the recovery of the north Canterbury economy after the quake, particularly in the hard-hit township of Kaikoura in New Zealand, famed for its coastal scenery and whale-watching, a tourism industry group leader told Xinhua Tuesday.Tourism industry and government agencies are moving to bolster confidence in China, New Zealand's fastest growing and second biggest tourism market, in the wake of the 7.5-magnitude quake, which killed two people in the north Canterbury region, said Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA) chief executive Chris Roberts.Tourism and government agencies were closely monitoring reactions in China, Roberts said.New Zealand tourism chiefs had issued an urgent appeal to prospective Chinese visitors after early Monday's deadly earthquake: Don't cancel your travel plans.The industry had learned from the Christchurch earthquakes, which killed 185 people in 2011, that the international media coverage risked portraying New Zealand as a whole devastated, said Roberts.""To date, we've been checking and there've been very, very few reports of people canceling planned trips to New Zealand, which is good,"" Roberts said in a phone interview.""But we do know from China in particular that yesterday, immediately following the quake, there was some anxiety and Chinese travel companies were receiving calls from customers about their planned trips to New Zealand this summer. Hopefully they're getting the right information to them that there is no reason to cancel a trip to New Zealand.""The TIA was part of the government-organized Civil Defense visitor response group, which was arranging ""official messaging"" through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), embassies and other channels.""The key from a tourism perspective is that New Zealand is still open for business. Yes, there's some disruption in north Canterbury, but the rest of the country is unaffected and we certainly want to welcome our tourists to keep coming to New Zealand over summer,"" said Roberts.""We know from the experience of the Christchurch earthquakes that Christchurch took a big hit and other parts of the South Island also did -- parts of the South Island that were actually completely unaffected by the earthquakes -- so we want to try to avoid that.""Monitoring the public response and getting out ""good information"" would be a key focus of MFAT and the government's Tourism New Zealand agency, which has an office in Shanghai, over coming weeks.Massive landslides cut off road and rail links to Kaikoura, making it accessible only by sea and by helicopter and sparking an airlift evacuation of about 1,000 stranded travelers on Tuesday.""We'd want to support Kaikoura and get it back on its feet once the immediate cleanup is carried out and the road is reopened. Hopefully the tourist flows will begin again for whale-watching and all the other activities because it's very important to that town that it's able to get back in operation as soon as possible,"" he said.Recovery of the tourism market was also essential to Chinese airlines that had recently begun direct flights into Christchurch and to Chinese carriers that were flying to New Zealand for the first time via the main gateway of Auckland.""They're flights from new regions of China for the first time coming into New Zealand, so those airlines will be keen to have those planes filled up,"" Roberts said.",http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1018008.shtml,en

During the height of the Arab Spring protests that swept the region in 2011, massive demonstrations in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a forced then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh out of office on charges of corruption and economic grievances. Hadi, his deputy at the time, took over in his absence. As with many countries in the region, the momentum of popular demonstrations soon turned into national instability, paving the way for Islamist groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to conduct deadly attacks. The militant group took advantage of the political chaos in 2011 and established territory in southern Yemen. Another opposition group underwent a resurgence due to the political instability. The Houthi movement, officially known as Ansar Allah (""Supporters of God""), revived a decade-long insurgency against the Yemeni government and took control of territory in the north. The Houthis represent the country's Zaidi Shiite minority, which ruled Yemen until 1962. As Hadi's government became increasingly unpopular, they began to attract support from various sectors of Yemeni society. In 2014, the Houthis entered Sana'a and Hadi was forced to flee to the southern city of Aden the following year. Hadi accused the Houthis of illegally taking power, while the Houthis maintain their coup was a popular resistance against Hadi's government.",http://www.ibtimes.com/middle-east-conflict-why-saudi-arabia-attacking-yemen-important-questions-surround-2447121,en

Has the world lost its senses, especially to feel the sufferings of the tormented? In an alleged effort to defeat the Houthi rebels, a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia, supported by the United States and the United Kingdom have been bombarding Yemen, already one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, with air-strikes since March 2015, sending it literally back to the stone-age. The war has triggered a major humanitarian crisis. Since the air-strikes began, “food prices [in Yemen] have gone up 60 percent, leaving 14 million people across the country classified as ‘food insecure’ (Yemen’s children die from bombs, bullets, hunger, ABC News, August 23).” According to figures provided in the New York Times, “the war has killed more than 6,500 people, displaced more than 2.5 million others and pushed one of the world’s poorest countries from deprivation to devastation (“America Is Complicit in the Carnage in Yemen”, August 17).” Other reports have shown these figures to be much higher. Meanwhile, the United Nations has blamed the coalition for at least 60 percent of deaths and injuries to children last year, warning along with human rights groups, that the coalition may have been “commissioning international war crimes” (Saudi-led coalition could be committing ‘international crimes’ bombing civilians in Yemen, UN warns, The Independent, March 19). At a press briefing at the United Nations on June 29, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International revealed that, “Unlawful air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition have killed and maimed hundreds of children in Yemen and damaged dozens of schools, but the coalition strong-armed the Secretary-General in an attempt to escape scrutiny.” That is, to have Saudi Arabia removed from the UN’s list of shame. The Secretary General Ban Ki-moon himself after being bullied said, “There has been fierce reaction to my decision to temporarily remove the Saudi-led Coalition countries from the report’s annex. This was one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make. The report describes horrors no child should have to face.”",http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/29/making-a-killing-in-yemen/,en
2922,2586,conflict,"Yet, the media, and especially the western media, continues to keep mum. Why? Well, one explanation may be that because the coalition consists of those allied with the West, the western media does not want to report on the alleged war crimes that they may have committed. Another reason for such deafening silence, however, may be because most of the killings are actually being committed using weapons supplied by the West. According to the Washington Post, the US has sold the Saudis a total of USD 20 billion in weapons over the last one year. Britain too has sold close to USD 4 billion worth of weapons to the Saudis. The Obama administration, despite aggressively lobbying for greater gun control in the US, “has discreetly brokered and authorised the sale of more arms to foreign governments than any other US president since World War II”, according to Owen B. McCormack. During the first five years of his tenure alone, “new agreements under the Pentagon’s Foreign Military Sales programme — the largest channel for US arms exports — totalled over USD 169 billion,” exceeding the amount authorised during the entire tenure of his predecessor by almost USD 30 billion. And, of course, the main recipient of American made weapons has been Saudi Arabia — “almost 10 percent of US arms exports” while 9 percent went “to the United Arab Emirates, an ally of Riyadh in the Yemen war (“Such a long silence on Yemen,” The Hindu, August 22).” According to Congressional Research Service, even as early as 2010, the Obama administration authorised the sale of a whopping USD 90.4 billion worth of arms to the Saudis. And according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, “arms imports to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states increased 71 percent from 2005-2009 to 2010-2014, accounting for 54 percent of imports to the Middle East in the latter period. Saudi Arabia rose to become the second largest importer of major weapons worldwide in 2010-2014, increasing the volume of its arms imports four times compared to 2005-2009.”",http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/29/making-a-killing-in-yemen/,en

And so it goes, with innocent Yemenis being torn to shreds by the most horrific of weapons out there, the Lords of War continue to make windfall profits. Fortunately for them, the media’s silence guarantees that there is no significant pressure to end the supply of weapons to maim and kill a bunch of poor people here and there. After all, how else will the demand for these weapons keep up with their massive supply? As the fictional character in the movie Lord of War, Yuri Orlov said, “where there’s a will, there’s a weapon”. And the “coalition of the willing”, whether it be to go to war in Iraq, or for the destruction of Yemen, have been more than ready to oblige to the will of western arms manufacturers. For the Yemenis, however, the horrors of having these weapons used on them are, unfortunately, very real.

Land became state-owned after independence in 1975. But since the end of the civil war in 2002 – and with land reform in 2004 – things have started to change. Foreign companies now invest in infrastructure, minerals, diamonds, oil and land. But the risk is that the rural population gets left behind as large areas are leased to foreign farming and mining companies, instead of providing for those who fled to the cities during the war but are now returning to the countryside. “Angola needs less bureaucracy when it comes to protect rural land that’s been in the possession of families without any legal papers,” says Quivienguele. “It requires strong leadership that can stir Angola into a sustainable future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/06/angola-land-rights-civil-war,en

3020,2684,other,"Angola has experienced rapid growth in the last decade, mostly propelled by the exploitation of its vast natural resources. Today, the country ranks as the third largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 1). Its history is characterised by struggle and battle. After its independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola endured a 27-year civil war, during which two major opposition parties, MPLA and Unita, fought for supremacy. In 2002, the two parties finally agreed on a cease-fire and started to focus on rebuilding the country. The rebirth of Angola started in 2002. Oil and diamonds From 2002 until recently, Angola relied on its natural resources as its main source of revenue. Oil makes up most of the country’s earnings. Angola is Africa’s second-largest oil producer, with much of its proven reserves concentrated in Cabinda Province, a region plagued by a separatist conflict. Oil production has more than doubled from about 800,000 barrels a day in 2001 to about 1.8 million barrels a day in 2015. This resource alone accounted for around 95% of foreign exchange revenues in 2014. Oil exports brought in US$60.2bn in revenues to the country in 2014. In 2015, foreign currency inflow generated by oil exports was $33.4bn, a 44.5% decline relative to the same period the previous year, a result of the drop in the oil price.",http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/angola-diversifying-oil/,en
3021,2685,conflict,"Diamonds account for a sizeable amount of revenue, although much smaller than that generated from oil. Angola is Africa’s third-largest diamond producer by quantity and value, surpassed only by Botswana, the world’s largest producer, with about 38 million carats, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 30 million carats. The country mined 10 million carats of diamond in 2014, generating a revenue of $1.6bn. Angola’s production volume oscillated between 9.7 and 8.3 million carats per year since 2006. The new mining code introduced in 2011 attracted foreign investment and boosted the exploration of the precious stone and other minerals. The extensive natural resources gave Angolans the possibility of rapid prosperity, but also the curse of trusting finite commodities for a continuous stream of revenue. Similarly to Nigeria, investments in Angola’s oil industry grew constantly over the past decade, dwarfing other sectors of the economy. In the colonial era, Angola was a major exporter of coffee, sisal, sugar cane, banana and cotton, and self-sufficient in all food crops except wheat. The civil war disrupted all agricultural production and displaced millions of people. The discovery of large oil reserves shifted the focus of the economy from agriculture to oil exploration. The country ceased to invest in technology and the mechanisation of its agricultural sector. Agricultural productivity decreased. The seemingly endless supply of oil money and the dismantled agricultural sector made it easier to import food, rather than invest in domestic production. From being a net agricultural exporter in the 1970s, Angola now imports 90% of its food – at a cost of $5bn a year. Of this, $300m worth of agricultural products were imported from the United States in 2014.",http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/angola-diversifying-oil/,en

The economy has recently undergone some structural changes to try to move away from its dependency on oil revenue. Time will tell whether it will be successful. A lot to be fixed Angola’s ranking as the third-largest GDP in sub-Saharan Africa is testimony to its natural resource wealth. However, this prominent position masks the socio-economic imbalances the country has been experiencing for decades. The drop in the oil price resulted in a shortage of revenue that could be balanced only by a cut in public spending. Government spending was cut to $24bn from $30bn projected in the original 2016 budget, as revenues were also slashed to $18bn from $24.4bn. The unfolding of this cut is palpable.

Corporate income taxes were also reduced from 35% to 30%. APIEX is housed within the Ministry of Commerce. Its creation follows various changes in legislation that come with the objective of facilitating external and domestic investment and easing access to loans for private investors. Besides this, Angola is making an effort to decrease the number of steps in the process of opening a business, and it is investing in the training of basic professional skills, providing guidance for new entrepreneurs, and creating industrial centres with planned infrastructure and logistics connections. The Angolan ambassador to Singapore, Fidelino Loy de Jesus Figueiredo, looks at the recent policy changes for foreign and national investment with great enthusiasm. In a written interview with me, Figueiredo said: “The new law creates an attractive framework for investors, protecting their interests, but without affecting the state’s welfare.

However, the law is clear and does not place restrains on it.” The law allows the repatriation of dividends, profits and royalties following the conclusion of the investment project. However, it will be subject to an additional tax. The new tax on dividends starts at 15%, and can rise to as high as 50%, depending on how much and how soon after the initial investment the repatriation takes place to encourage in-country re-investments. The new investment law sets a minimum of 35% local participation or partnership in foreign investments and focuses on six strategic sectors: electricity and water; tourism and hospitality; transportation and logistics; telecommunications and information technology; construction; and media. The 35% minimum local participation requirement is likely to challenge foreign investors pursuing large investments projects to obtain qualifying local partners, especially due to local capital constraints, as well as the lack of technical capacity in certain industries.",http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/angola-diversifying-oil/,en

The same is applied to the banking sector, which has a distinct law dictating how foreign investments can be assimilated. For the sectors encompassed in the new law, there are fiscal incentives for investing in Angola’s less developed regions. Investing in less developed areas has twice the level of incentives as compared to investing in areas near Luanda or other major city centres. Additional tax breaks are available for investors who create more local jobs, generate higher export receipts, and source more local content in their operations. Although the six strategic areas embraced by the law present decisive opportunities for Angola, there are two sectors that should receive broader attention: agriculture, and fisheries.

It grew by a negligible 0.2% in 2015, and only about a third of Angola’s arable land has been cultivated. The country was a net exporter of agricultural products in the colonial era. It certainly has the young working force, right climate and arable land to expand its agricultural and fishery sectors. Although some advances have been made in these areas, there is still a long way to go in order to alleviate Angola’s dependency on food imports. Recently, Angola shipped, for the first time in more than 40 years, a cargo of 17 tonnes of bananas to Europe. The growth of banana production in Angola was fuelled by Chinese money after agreements exchanging oil for infrastructure development were signed between the two countries back in 2004. Banana production grew from 76,000 tonnes in 2012 to 247,000 tonnes in 2013, which not only ended banana imports, but also allowed exports to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.",http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/angola-diversifying-oil/,en

The country has a target to increase this output to 400,000 tonnes in the coming years. Angola has rich coastal waters and a well-watered interior. Its active fisheries also include rivers, freshwater lakes and reservoirs. The country’s coast is 1,600 km long and its exclusive economic zone waters cover 330,000 km². The country has plenty of potential to significantly increase the size of its fishing industry. Developing aquaculture and expanding the fishing industry in Angola have the potential to generate jobs and to contribute to food security and poverty reduction, especially in rural and coastal areas. It is also a decisive sub-sector in Angola in terms of social impact. One-third of Angola’s animal protein come from fish, and artisan fishing represents 30% of the country’s total fishing activity countrywide. Many involved in the fishing industry are organised in co-operatives, and over 80% of their members are women. Angola is also developing its fish-farming potential. Its first major initiative at the Mucoso centre near Dondo, Kwanza Norte province, opened in April 2014. Bengo province, near Luanda, has several large lakes, such as Nagume, and lagoons that support traditional artisan fisheries. The Kwanza river is also home to several existing and new dam projects.

Starting in 2014 and forecasted to go through the next decade, Angola’s current account is expected to run on deficit (see Figure 2). The lower oil prices and higher imports have narrowed the resource-rich country’s current account surplus. Oil export revenues, which dominate foreign-exchange earnings, declined as global oil prices started falling in 2014, highlighting the necessity for the diversification of the economy and decoupling public finances from the oil sector.",http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/angola-diversifying-oil/,en

It spiked to 23% in the first quarter of 2016 from the 2015 annual rate of 14.3%, exceeding the central bank’s target. The high inflation is a result of currency devaluation and the cessation of the government’s fuel subsidies in early 2016. Concerns about inflation led the central bank to hike interest rates.

Equally important is to foster investments in infrastructure, deepening financial sector reforms, developing professional skills and improving the business environment. Investing in the local industry will result in a gradual reduction of imports, which is essential in a scenario of weak local currency. Angola’s new law for foreign investment is an important step to making the business environment clearer for the external investor. Reducing bureaucracy and facilitating credit are also part of the measures the government is trying to implement. Notwithstanding these reforms, the legal framework still needs adjustments to ease the business environment. Income inequality, unemployment and poverty remain a challenge in Angola.

The main case for biofeuels is twofold. It’s supposed to be better for the environment, particularly global warming, and lessen our dependence on foreign oil. The assumption was that converting plants into fuel was “carbon neutral,” and since we can do that at home, every gallon of oil we replace with corn is one less we have to buy from overseas. The fact that it also lines the pockets of agribusinesses and the politicians who love them is supposed to be a total coincidence and irrelevant to this good and noble policy.

Researchers found that biofuels actually create more greenhouse gases than simply using petroleum, because plants only absorb a fraction of the carbon dioxide released by burning the fuels in the first place. Moreover, ethanol production and distribution is energy-intensive, throwing off even more greenhouse gases. “When you look at what’s actually happening on the land, you find that not enough carbon is being removed from the atmosphere to balance what’s coming out of the tailpipe,” University of Michigan professor John DeCicco said. “When it comes to the emissions that cause global warming, it turns out that biofuels are worse than gasoline.” A study last year by the University of Tennessee found that in the decade since the U.S. imposed the Renewable Fuel Standard -- and after $50 billion in subsidies -- corn-based ethanol “created more problems than solutions” and hampered research on other kinds of biofuels.",http://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/09/03/goldberg-right-time-talk-ethanol/89843418/,en

Growing corn for inefficient fuel takes up farmland, raising food prices and encouraging deforestation. Science writer Matt Ridley has estimated that if all of our transport fuel came from biofuel, we would need 30 percent more land than all of the existing food-growing farmland we have today. All of the corn we grow requires vast amounts of fertilizer, which runs into our waterways and out to the Gulf of Mexico. Every year that runoff creates a massive -- and growing -- dead zone that kills sea life in one of our most valuable fisheries. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization, “Habitats that would normally be teeming with life become, essentially, biological deserts.” This year’s dead zone will be the size of Connecticut, researchers say. Meanwhile, in places such as Brazil, CO2-absorbing rainforests (among the biggest sources of biodiversity) are being clear-cut to make room for biofuel crops. The Nature Conservancy’s Joseph Fargione estimated a few years ago that converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas or grasslands for biofuels releases 17 to 420 times more CO2 than it offsets by displacing petroleum or coal.",http://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/09/03/goldberg-right-time-talk-ethanol/89843418/,en

Thanks to the shale oil revolution, America now has greater oil reserves than Saudi Arabia and Russia. Domestic oil production produces far more -- and far better paying -- jobs than ethanol production. Cheaper oil also cascades through the economy, creating more jobs.

3134,2798,conflict,"Several issues have been calling for the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari in recent times. Of the six or seven issues I’ve listed so far, the president has responded to only one: budget padding. And his response was too feeble. The penalty for a heinous crime like budget padding can’t be redeployment. I expected all those involved to have lost their jobs first and then have their days in court. The alternative is for the president to accept responsibility for the crime and then resign. US President Harry Truman reminded all leaders of this heavy responsibility in a notice on his office table: THE BUCK STOPS HERE. Having spent decades outside of government, President Buhari of Nigeria should know that Nigerians always ascribe every deed, good or bad, to the head of government at the time. Lest the presidency forget, here’s a quick reminder of pending issues: Killer herdsmen in Benue: Thousands of people displaced from Agatu LGA of Benue State have yet to return to their homes. Soldiers deployed to the area to restore law and order are failing in their duty, as more people have been killed in the area and other parts of the state. Many now agree with me that the killers are mercenaries from perhaps Mali, Chad and Libya, not rustic herdsmen who can’t handle a rifle. How many of the murderers have been arrested by security operatives? Over 400 men, women and children are dead already. Political killings in Rivers: Before yesterday’s polls in Rivers State, we saw gory pictures of headless bodies in the state and in an institution in Abia State. A few days ago, the victims of politically motivated murders in Rivers State included at least two soldiers and a DSS operative. As I write this, voting goes on in the state but the news from there is not pleasant. Will the president condemn cultists and thugs and then go to sleep? When Obasanjo ordered a massacre in Odi after the killing of 10 soldiers or so, it was not hailed because he and the soldiers overreacted. They killed innocent people long after the culprits had escaped. This time, Buhari should fish out the murderers and their sponsors – and then deal with them. And if the Rivers State government failed to cooperate by helping to find the killers, the president would be justified to declare a state of emergency in the state.",http://www.leadership.ng/columns/510577/the-buck-stops-here,en

I’ve seen fungi growing on a prisoner’s body! Skin diseases are common. Malnutrition is evident in their exposed skeletons. Little wonder many die in Nigerian prisons. What is worse? Most of them are not serving prison terms – they have been awaiting trial for years. Some of them committed no crime but were put there by “big” people. Some committed crimes like chicken theft, palm-oil theft and land-trespass offences. President Buhari can intervene by ordering the courts to finish up their cases or grant them bail immediately. Many of them could be pardoned too. At least, the prisons should be decongested to make room for the billionaire looters of our common wealth. Redundant laws: It’s good to inform the president of the penchant of our lawmakers for time-wasting, despite the humongous amounts they earn as salary each month. A National Assembly that has failed to pass important bills (like the PIB) in 12 years preoccupies itself with “gender equality” bill. Our constitution makes males and females equal: no discrimination because of sex. I wonder what else the gender equality bill seeks to achieve.

The events following the contested results in the presidential vote in the 2007 General Election (where 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands others were displaced) offers sobering lessons: that a mismanaged electoral process can lead to death and destruction and sink a country; that all parties in an electoral contest must have confidence in the process if the outcome is to be believed. Hopefully, the next step will seek to cure that and restore the trust and confidence in elections as an integral part of a democracy where the majority have their way and the minority have their say. The joint select committee on the IEBC owes it to Kenyans to deliver resolutions that transcend all the vested interests and restores that trust.",http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000211680/signs-of-a-breakthrough-over-iebc-encouraging,en

We act in direct response to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which was initiated by Palestinian civil society in 2005 and is endorsed by over 170 Palestinian political parties and organizations. The BDS movement calls on Israel to comply with international law by (1) Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands occupied in June 1967 and dismantling the Wall, (2) Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and (3) Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194. The specific corporations our resolution targets for divestment are Boeing, Caterpillar, Cemex, Elbit Systems, General Electric, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lockheed Martin, Motorola Systems, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Collectively, these companies perpetuate apartheid and human rights abuses by providing technology and resources used by the Israeli military and government to attack and kill Palestinian civilians, maintain and build the Apartheid Wall and checkpoints, and destroy Palestinian property for the purpose of building illegal settlements. For example, Boeing supplies aircraft, missiles, and weapons used to attack Palestinians in the occupied territories including during the 2014 summer assault on Gaza, which, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, damaged or destroyed over 144 kindergartens, killed 2,205 Palestinians, displaced over 500,000, and left 108,000 homeless. Cemex operates four factories on occupied land and produces concrete elements used in the construction of illegal settlements, the Apartheid Wall, and checkpoints; and Elbit Systems Ltd. provides the electronic detection fence and surveillance cameras for the Apartheid Wall and supplies unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used to kill and maim Palestinians in the occupied territories. Unfortunately, the University of Chicago has a long history of both failing to take socially responsible stances and actively perpetuating systems of oppression. Our university failed to divest from South Africa and Darfur even though many of our peer institutions did. The school also failed to divest from fossil fuels or to form a socially responsible investment committee, even though both initiatives were supported by an overwhelming majority (70-80%) of the student body. It has played a major role both locally and nationally in perpetuating segregation and gentrification. Other anti-Black components of the school’s history include maintaining a huge, unaccountable private police force and flatly refusing to provide trauma care to the South Side, until relentless activism from a coalition led by young Black organizers forced the university to change course. The University of Chicago is currently under investigation for multiple Title IX violations, has perpetuated unfair labor practices, and consistently fails to adequately address racist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, anti-Semitic, and anti-Palestinian incidents on campus. On a global scale, the Chicago School of Economics was a major producer and proponent of economic theories and policies that lead to the dismantling of the welfare state, decimation of poor and middle class communities, and rise of mass incarceration. Additionally, it aided and abetted multiple murderous, racist, and anti-Semitic Latin American regimes.",http://mondoweiss.net/2016/03/road-to-south-africa-has-never-been-shorter-as-u-of-chicago-launches-divestment-campaign/,en
