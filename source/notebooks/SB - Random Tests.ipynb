    "content = \"\"\"South Africa is arresting a growing number of asylum seekers when they attempt to renew their asylum permits. Mxolisi Ncube speaks to Zimbabweans sent home and the human rights groups challenging the deportations.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRETORIA, South Africa – Sheila* woke at 3 a.m. on a cold Tuesday morning. After hitchhiking three rides from Johannesburg, she completed the 38-mile journey to Pretoria and arrived at the Desmond Tutu Refugee Reception Office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining a queue of fellow migrants, the 38-year-old from Zimbabwe realized there were no more than 75 people ahead of her, which meant she stood a good chance of submitting her asylum seeker’s permit for a renewal stamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three hours later – after pushing and shoving in the crowd, and bribing a security guard to hold her spot in a line that had grown to more than 500 people – she finally managed to submit her permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 10 a.m., a woman came out of the office holding a pile of papers and started calling names. Those called were ushered to a South African police truck parked at the corner of the yard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without explanation, Sheila and about 45 other migrants were crammed into the truck and taken to the Lindela Repatriation Center, where they were told they had been arrested because their applications for refugee status had been rejected. She was detained at Lindela for four months, then deported to Beitbridge, Zimbabwe, just across the border from northern South Africa.\n",
    "Growing Arrests\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a million people have sought asylum in South Africa since 2006, according to the country’s Department of Home Affairs (DHA). Most come from Zimbabwe, while others are from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique and other African nations, as well as countries such as India and Pakistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid a backlog of asylum applications, an increasing number of asylum seekers have been deported in recent months, often without due process, say South African human rights groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 50 and 150 people are arrested each day when they attempt to renew their permits, according to estimates by rights groups. They are detained at Lindela and eventually deported to their home country.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are concerned about the possibilities of abuse of process,” said Sharon Ekambaram, manager of Lawyers for Human Rights’ Refugee and Migrant Rights Project. In many cases, asylum seekers do not receive written decisions of final rejection, but are merely advised verbally and given a notice to appear before the immigration inspectorate for deportation, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asylum seeker permits – also known as Section 22 permits – are valid for six months and make it legal for people to stay in South Africa pending a decision on their asylum application. The system calls for several rounds of reviews before an asylum seeker can be rejected and deported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the permit expires, the asylum seeker is interviewed by a refugee status determination officer, who makes a ruling – either granting asylum, rejecting the application or referring questions of law to the Standing Committee for Refugee Affairs (SCRA). In case of rejection, an asylum seeker can appeal within 30 days. The Refugee Appeal Board then conducts another hearing before deciding whether to confirm, set aside or substitute the initial decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observers claim, however, that this process is not being followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have instances where the SCRA had not made a decision, despite the contrary being communicated to the client,” Ekambaram said. “We have requested written decisions signed by the SCRA, and while we have noted a few receiving some, it appears not to be widely used.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The African Diaspora Forum, a nongovernmental organization established in 2008 to safeguard the rights of migrants in South Africa, said it had not held a dialogue with the DHA about the issue since 2016. DHA officials “are not ready to be engaged on the matter,” said African Diaspora Forum Chairman Marc Gbaffou, an Ivorian refugee who lives in South Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gbaffou said many migrants are held for 120 days or more in Lindela, beyond the legal maximum of 90 days. “Most of these would have had their permits expired because they were denied a chance to renew them by the guards and officials wanting to deal with a certain number,” he said.\n",
    "Asylum System in Crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zimbabwe Exiles Forum, a nonprofit organization formed by political and economic refugees in South Africa, said it has received many reports of arrests and deportations in recent months.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have visited Lindela and noted with serious concern that those arrested for deportation include those either attempting to apply for or renewing asylum and refugee status,” said Gabriel Shumba, executive director of Zimbabwe Exiles Forum. “This practice is not only insensitive, but falls afoul of international prescripts.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    “The current asylum protection system is in crisis and is effectively nonfunctional.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ekambaram said the DHA’s actions ignore South Africa’s international and domestic legal commitments. “[South Africa’s] Refugees Act established a parallel legal framework, separate from the Immigration Act, which sets up its own procedures for the detention of asylum seekers and refugees and prohibits their detention as illegal foreigners under the Immigration Act,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yet, despite the existence of a separate legal regime for asylum seekers and refugees, the DHA has applied the Immigration Act, arresting [asylum seekers] as illegal foreigners and subjecting them to arbitrary, indefinite and unlawful detention pending deportation,” she said. “These activities fall outside of the [DHA’s] authority. The current asylum protection system is in crisis and is effectively nonfunctional.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The DHA declined to respond to questions from Refugees Deeply. Lawyers for Human Rights has submitted written and verbal requests to the DHA for an independent oversight mechanism, in an effort to hold the department accountable.\n",
    "‘Keep Running’\n",
    "\n",
    "Sheila initially fled to South Africa from Lupane, Zimbabwe, to escape political persecution. She received death threats from state security agents, she claimed, because of her active role in the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party in Zimbabwe.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she was deported to Beitbridge, she feared for her life if she returned to Lupane. So she came back to South Africa and now lives undocumented in Johannesburg – too afraid to claim asylum again.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I want to be legal in South Africa because I cannot keep running away from the police,” she said. “But I am now afraid to go back and apply for new asylum because I might get arrested again. For now, I will have to keep running from the police or bribing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wish the 2018 elections will bring in a new government and make things normal in Zimbabwe again, so that I can return and live a normal life.”\"\"\""

    "s = \"Madeleine Kingston/MSF Rohingya refugees set up makeshift shelters, having arrived in Bangladesh. This massive influx, coming on top of 75,000 people who have arrived since violence began in October 2016, represents one of the largest influxes ever of Rohingyas into Bangladesh. Amsterdam - International humanitarian organisations must immediately be granted independent and unfettered access, including for international staff, to alleviate massive humanitarian needs in Rakhine State, Myanmar MSFs call for urgent access comes amid the ongoing military operations in Rakhine, which started on 25 August after a new spate of attacks against police stations and a military base claimed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). As a consequence, more than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh and are living in extremely precarious conditions with limited access to health care, drinking water, latrines and food. The remaining population in Northern Rakhine, thought to be hundreds of thousands of people, is without any meaningful form of humanitarian assistance. Our teams in Bangladesh are hearing alarming stories of severe violence against civilians in Northern Rakhine, says Karline Kleijer, MSF emergency desk manager. Reports says there is significant internal displacement of Rohingya, ethnic Rakhine populations and other minorities. Villages and houses have been burned down, including at least two out of four of MSFs clinics. MSF was providing healthcare services in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Northern Rakhine before they were put on hold due to a lack of travel authorisation and a ban on international staff in mid-August, Ms Kleijer said. We fear that the people remaining there are unable to access the help they may need. Injured, sick or chronically ill people in Northern Rakhine must be accessed without further delay, while emergency healthcare and other humanitarian assistance should be provided. In Central Rakhine, approximately 120,000 internally displaced people remain in camps where they are entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival, due to severe movement restrictions. MSF used to provide mobile clinics in several camps and villages for displaced people, but international staff have not been granted travel authorisations to visit the health facilities since August, whilst national staff have been too afraid to go to work following remarks by Myanmar officials accusing NGOs of colluding with ARSA. The government-formulated and disseminated accusations against the UN and international NGOs, denial of required travel and activity authorisations, and threatening statements and actions by hardline groups, are all preventing independent humanitarian workers from providing much-needed assistance. Moreover Northern Rakhine has been declared a military zone by the government of Myanmar, resulting in even more severe administrative and access constraints. The government of Myanmar says it wants to exclusively implement the humanitarian response to those affected in Rakhine, sparking fears that aid might not reach those who most need it. Madeleine Kingston/MSF Rohingya who crossed into Bangladesh, fleeing violence in Rakhine state, Myanmar that started on 25 August. This suggests Myanmar is moving towards a new modus operandi putting the delivery of humanitarian aid under the governments exclusive control, which is likely to result in even more severe administrative and access constraints than ever, says Benoit De Gryse, MSFs operations manager for Myanmar. The only way to ensure aid is provided based on needs and is trusted by all populations, is for it to be provided by independent neutral humanitarian actors. MSF is alarmed by the current lack of access to healthcare for those remaining in Rakhine. When it has full access to its clinics, MSF provides over 11,000 primary and reproductive healthcare consultations per month, as well as emergency transport and assistance for patients requiring hospitalisation. All these services are currently on hold, and other agencies have also reported being unable to carry out their activities in Rakhine due to lack of access. To ensure access to medical care and to be able to provide assistance to conflict-affected people, MSF and other international humanitarian agencies must be allowed immediate and unhindered access to all areas of Rakhine State. Without this, there is a very real risk that patients will die unnecessarily, says De Gryse. *MSFs medical projects in other areas of Myanmar; namely Shan and Kachin states and Yangon and Thanintharyi, continue to operate as usual. MSFs regular projects include HIV, tuberculosis, primary healthcare, sexual and reproductive healthcare, emergency referrals to public hospitals and malaria treatment. **MSF has worked in Myanmar for 25 years, working with the Ministry of Health and Sports to provide care for HIV and TB patients, primary healthcare, and vaccinations. In Rakhine State, Myanmar, MSF usually operates mobile clinics providing primary healthcare consultations in a number of villages and displaced population camps, and organising emergency medical referrals to MoHS hospitals. MSF also usually supports the provision of HIV treatment in MoHS hospitals in Northern Rakhine. In Central Rakhine, MSF also usually treats TB patients in cooperation with the National TB programme. Until mid-August, MSF was providing healthcare services in Pauktaw, Sittwe, Ponnagyun, Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships.\""

    "test_content = \"\"\"PHILLIP MBUGO Hundreds of people sheltering from violence at Bangasu camp in the Western Equatorian region of South Sudan have received humanitarian relief for the first time since they fled their homes in June. A peacekeeping patrol serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan provided safe passage for the delivery of aid by humanitarian agencies to more than 800 households at two camps, who received cooking utensils, buckets and tarpaulins to provide much-needed shelter from the heavy rains. The journey to these camps involves the convoy navigating waterlogged roads damaged by heavy rain and the war that has ravaged South Sudan for almost four years. The convoy passed by villages abandoned by residents who fled after coming under attack earlier this year. No one knows exactly how many people died in the raids but many of the homes have been looted or burnt to the ground. Those sheltering at Bangasu camp say both sides involved in the ongoing conflict are responsible for their predicament. “It is difficult because as the incident happened the government was patrolling these places searching for the rebels and the rebels were also active here moving through the villages,” said Bangasu camp chief, Moses Ruzino. The patrol was also able to reach Rimenze camp further to the north where hundreds of people have sought sanctuary in a makeshift camp next to the Catholic Church. Despite the presence of the church, the families here still suffer from regular threats, harassment, beatings and looting by armed groups. “Of course we are scared because there is no protection, you know, anyone can just come and enter the camp, as has happened several times back, that the rebels can come in the camp beginning to beat people and to loot from people,” said Moses Ruzino. “That is why we are putting our request to the UN come here to protect the civilians here.” The peacekeeping mission has two purposes. Firstly, to provide a protective presence in the area, even if it is temporary, and, secondly, to facilitate the delivery of aid by humanitarian agencies who have been struggling to safely reach the displaced civilians. Life is difficult in these camps without access to clean drinking water, food, or adequate shelter. “It is really very difficult for us to survive in this place because even when we run, all our food items were looted, and all our food items are now spoiled. We are just staying, waiting, to see who can help us by providing us a little food so we can help our children and women,” said Bangasu camp chief, James Atoroba. Bangasu camp resident, Atonita Daniel, is particularly grateful for the assistance. Her husband was killed during violent clashes in the area in 2015. Since then, she has been raising her nine children on her own. The simple gift of a plastic sheet will make a huge difference in protecting them from the heavy rain. “I have experienced hardship for the first time in my life with my nine children whose father was killed on his way to sell charcoal in the town and left me alone. The children and I are telling those who are fighting to stop senseless war and I also urge UN to bring peace to South Sudan at any cost. We are tired,” she said. The people in these camps want to go home to grow their crops, raise their children and live a peaceful and prosperous life. However, it is simply not safe enough to return. They say there are armed groups in the bush who continue to loot the deserted homes and military forces often follow them, harassing and beating them, in an attempt to find out where armed opposition groups are located. “My message to the government of South Sudan and also the international community is that they have to bring peace so that we can go back to our own places so that our children can go to school. We need peace,” said Moses Ruzino in Rimenze. That simple plea echoed by those back down the long road to Bangusa. “We don’t like to stay just the way we are, squeezing ourselves here in the camp. We need protection because we want to go back to our local area,” said James Atoroba. “We don’t like war. We want all the gunshots to stop in our area. We do not want to see any rebels moving with their guns anywhere or looting people’s property. We need peace.” Peace so that the people of Bangusa and Rimenze can live their lives safely, with dignity, and hope for a brighter future.\"\"\""

       "'PHILLIP MBUGO Hundreds of people sheltering from violence at Bangasu camp in the Western Equatorian region of South Sudan have received humanitarian relief for the first time since they fled their homes in June. A peacekeeping patrol serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan provided safe passage for the delivery of aid by humanitarian agencies to more than 800 households at two camps, who received cooking utensils, buckets and tarpaulins to provide much-needed shelter from the heavy rains. The journey to these camps involves the convoy navigating waterlogged roads damaged by heavy rain and the war that has ravaged South Sudan for almost four years. The convoy passed by villages abandoned by residents who fled after coming under attack earlier this year. No one knows exactly how many people died in the raids but many of the homes have been looted or burnt to the ground. Those sheltering at Bangasu camp say both sides involved in the ongoing conflict are responsible for their predicament. “It is difficult because as the incident happened the government was patrolling these places searching for the rebels and the rebels were also active here moving through the villages,” said Bangasu camp chief, Moses Ruzino. The patrol was also able to reach Rimenze camp further to the north where hundreds of people have sought sanctuary in a makeshift camp next to the Catholic Church. Despite the presence of the church, the families here still suffer from regular threats, harassment, beatings and looting by armed groups. “Of course we are scared because there is no protection, you know, anyone can just come and enter the camp, as has happened several times back, that the rebels can come in the camp beginning to beat people and to loot from people,” said Moses Ruzino. “That is why we are putting our request to the UN come here to protect the civilians here.” The peacekeeping mission has two purposes. Firstly, to provide a protective presence in the area, even if it is temporary, and, secondly, to facilitate the delivery of aid by humanitarian agencies who have been struggling to safely reach the displaced civilians. Life is difficult in these camps without access to clean drinking water, food, or adequate shelter. “It is really very difficult for us to survive in this place because even when we run, all our food items were looted, and all our food items are now spoiled. We are just staying, waiting, to see who can help us by providing us a little food so we can help our children and women,” said Bangasu camp chief, James Atoroba. Bangasu camp resident, Atonita Daniel, is particularly grateful for the assistance. Her husband was killed during violent clashes in the area in 2015. Since then, she has been raising her nine children on her own. The simple gift of a plastic sheet will make a huge difference in protecting them from the heavy rain. “I have experienced hardship for the first time in my life with my nine children whose father was killed on his way to sell charcoal in the town and left me alone. The children and I are telling those who are fighting to stop senseless war and I also urge UN to bring peace to South Sudan at any cost. We are tired,” she said. The people in these camps want to go home to grow their crops, raise their children and live a peaceful and prosperous life. However, it is simply not safe enough to return. They say there are armed groups in the bush who continue to loot the deserted homes and military forces often follow them, harassing and beating them, in an attempt to find out where armed opposition groups are located. “My message to the government of South Sudan and also the international community is that they have to bring peace so that we can go back to our own places so that our children can go to school. We need peace,” said Moses Ruzino in Rimenze. That simple plea echoed by those back down the long road to Bangusa. “We don’t like to stay just the way we are, squeezing ourselves here in the camp. We need protection because we want to go back to our local area,” said James Atoroba. “We don’t like war. We want all the gunshots to stop in our area. We do not want to see any rebels moving with their guns anywhere or looting people’s property. We need peace.” Peace so that the people of Bangusa and Rimenze can live their lives safely, with dignity, and hope for a brighter future.'"

       "'PHILLIP MBUGO Hundreds of people sheltering from violence at Bangasu camp in the Western Equatorian region of South Sudan have received humanitarian relief for the first time since they fled their homes in June. A peacekeeping patrol serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan provided safe passage for the delivery of aid by humanitarian agencies to more than 800 households at two camps, who received cooking utensils, buckets and tarpaulins to provide much-needed shelter from the heavy rains. The journey to these camps involves the convoy navigating waterlogged roads damaged by heavy rain and the war that has ravaged South Sudan for almost four years. The convoy passed by villages abandoned by residents who fled after coming under attack earlier this year. No one knows exactly how many people died in the raids but many of the homes have been looted or burnt to the ground. Those sheltering at Bangasu camp say both sides involved in the ongoing conflict are responsible for their predicament. “It is difficult because as the incident happened the government was patrolling these places searching for the rebels and the rebels were also active here moving through the villages,” said Bangasu camp chief, Moses Ruzino. The patrol was also able to reach Rimenze camp further to the north where hundreds of people have sought sanctuary in a makeshift camp next to the Catholic Church. Despite the presence of the church, the families here still suffer from regular threats, harassment, beatings and looting by armed groups. “Of course we are scared because there is no protection, you know, anyone can just come and enter the camp, as has happened several times back, that the rebels can come in the camp beginning to beat people and to loot from people,” said Moses Ruzino. “That is why we are putting our request to the UN come here to protect the civilians here.” The peacekeeping mission has two purposes. Firstly, to provide a protective presence in the area, even if it is temporary, and, secondly, to facilitate the delivery of aid by humanitarian agencies who have been struggling to safely reach the displaced civilians. Life is difficult in these camps without access to clean drinking water, food, or adequate shelter. “It is really very difficult for us to survive in this place because even when we run, all our food items were looted, and all our food items are now spoiled. We are just staying, waiting, to see who can help us by providing us a little food so we can help our children and women,” said Bangasu camp chief, James Atoroba. Bangasu camp resident, Atonita Daniel, is particularly grateful for the assistance. Her husband was killed during violent clashes in the area in 2015. Since then, she has been raising her nine children on her own. The simple gift of a plastic sheet will make a huge difference in protecting them from the heavy rain. “I have experienced hardship for the first time in my life with my nine children whose father was killed on his way to sell charcoal in the town and left me alone. The children and I are telling those who are fighting to stop senseless war and I also urge UN to bring peace to South Sudan at any cost. We are tired,” she said. The people in these camps want to go home to grow their crops, raise their children and live a peaceful and prosperous life. However, it is simply not safe enough to return. They say there are armed groups in the bush who continue to loot the deserted homes and military forces often follow them, harassing and beating them, in an attempt to find out where armed opposition groups are located. “My message to the government of South Sudan and also the international community is that they have to bring peace so that we can go back to our own places so that our children can go to school. We need peace,” said Moses Ruzino in Rimenze. That simple plea echoed by those back down the long road to Bangusa. “We don’t like to stay just the way we are, squeezing ourselves here in the camp. We need protection because we want to go back to our local area,” said James Atoroba. “We don’t like war. We want all the gunshots to stop in our area. We do not want to see any rebels moving with their guns anywhere or looting people’s property. We need peace.” Peace so that the people of Bangusa and Rimenze can live their lives safely, with dignity, and hope for a brighter future.'"

    "c = 'Situation Overview  Monsoon rains and increased water levels in major rivers have caused seasonal floods in Myanmar, primarily affecting Magway, Sagaing, Bago and Ayeyarwady regions and Mon State. Mandalay Region, Chin, Kayin, Rakhine and Shan states, as well as the Union Territory, are also affected by floods but with smaller-scale or no displacements reported at this stage. As of 25 July, the cumulative number of people who had been temporarily displaced/evacuated since the beginning of July in flood-affected states and regions was reported to be almost 140,000, according to the Government of Myanmar’s Relief and Resettlement Department (RRD) in Nay Pyi Taw. At least three people are reported to have died due to flooding. In some areas flood waters have receded and people have returned to their homes. As of 25 July, out of a total of 269 evacuation sites, 107 had been closed again, mainly in Sagaing, Mon, Rakhine and the Union Territory. In addition to those displaced/evacuated between 2 and 25 July, thousands more have been affected by flooding. People who are displaced are staying in monasteries, in temporary shelters or with host families or relatives.  Most severely affected states/regions (displacement figures as of 25 July)  Magway remains the most severely affected region with over 92,000 people reported to have been temporarily displaced across 12 townships, with Pokkoku, Yesagyo and Yenanchaung townships the worst affected, according to RRD. Flood waters in some of these townships are reported to be receding and people returning to their homes. However, the Magway regional RRD reports that many of those most severely affected live along the banks of the Ayayerwady River and may be displaced multiple times as flooding is likely to reoccur in these areas over the course of the monsoon season. Some families, who live in low lying areas, remain displaced as flooding continues to affect their homes. As of 25 July, a total of 55 evacuation sites in Magway remained open. In Sagaing Region, more than 23,000 people were temporarily displaced. However, all temporary evacuation sites in the region are now reported to have been closed and most of those displaced are reported to have returned to their homes after flood waters receded, according to RRD in Sagaing.  In Bago Region, over 10,000 people from eight townships have been temporarily displaced, while more than 6,700 people in nine townships in the Ayeyarwady Region are being accommodated in evacuation centres or staying with host families. In Mon State, some 5,000 people were displaced by floods over the past week but many have since been able to return to their homes. Floods also temporarily displaced over 1,100 people in Rakhine State and strong winds, heavy rain and swollen rivers have destroyed 75 houses and damaged another 120 homes in Mrauk-U, Minbya, Kyauktaw, Toungup and Ann townships since 24 July. Some of those displaced have since been able to return to their homes. In Mandalay Region, thousands of people affected by rising water levels have reportedly moved to safer locations on their own accord as a preventive measure.  Response  The Government of Myanmar is leading the flood response. RRD, in coordination with local authorities and different government departments, is responding to the immediate needs of displaced families by providing cash to purchase rice rations and distributing drinking water and relief items. Assistance is being provided in areas recently affected by floods, including Rakhine, Ayayerwady and Mon. The Union Minister of the Department of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Department visited Kyaikhto Township in Mon State on 23 July and provided immediate assistance to flood affected/displaced households, as well fiber boats and life jackets to the township authorities. RRD is also providing cash to repair and rebuild houses that were damaged or washed away. Meanwhile, RRD has pre-positioned emergency tarpaulins and water purification tablets in Ayeyarwady, Bago and Magway regions. The Myanmar Military is also providing assistance, including food, drinking water, warm clothes and blankets, mobile health clinics, as well as supporting flood preparedness measures, evacuations and clean up in a number of flood-affected areas. In collaboration with the Township Health Department, local authorities are organizing chlorination of water sources and pond cleaning/renovation in areas where flood waters have subsided.  The Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) is providing evacuation services in affected townships, assisting with water and sanitation in evacuation sites. MRCS is also providing food, drinking water, emergency tarpaulins and shelter tool kits, hygiene kits and mosquito nets, as well as first aid and emergency healthcare services. INGOs have provided water and sanitation support, including chlorination of water sources and distributing water purification tablets in Sagaing Region. UN agencies continue to closely monitor the situation and remain in contact with local and national authorities and stand ready to support the Government’s Response, if required.  Needs/Gaps: In Magway Region, as some people from low-lying areas remain displaced in temporary evacuation sites and some people may be temporarily displaced again during the coming weeks as the monsoon season continues, there may be a need for additional assistance, particularly for food, tarpaulins and water and sanitation support, according to the regional RRD. Local authorities and RRD have provided initial assistance and are closely monitoring the situation. The UN and MRCS are also following the situation and liaising closely with the regional authorities to respond to further humanitarian needs, if required.  Weather Outlook  The Government of Myanmar’s Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) has issued flood warnings for a few townships in Ayeyarwady and Bago regions as the water levels of rivers have reached above danger levels and advised people who live in low lying areas/close to rivers to take precautionary measures. DMH reported on 27 July that rains or thundershowers will be widespread in all states and regions with increased rains in Tanintharyi Region, as well as in Kayin and Mon states.'"
